            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THe Diſcourſe which ſome time ſince you were pleaſed to honour me by your Commands of appearing before you with, was but a proof of a larger Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe concerning Prayer, not long before diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It was then far from any deſign of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing: but I ſince finding many things by me, and many more coming to my Mind not altogether unworthy (as I thought) the peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of the more candid and intelligent, which might moſt conveniently appear ſomewhere inſerted in the handling of ſuch an Argument, I was inclined to make uſe of the Opportunity.</p>
            <p>I own the moſt ordinary and common Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Dedications, <hi>viz.</hi> to teſtifie the real and inward Honour and Reſpect I have for the many excellent Qualities of your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
<pb facs="tcp:94938:3"/> to expreſs my Acknowledgment par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to your Lordſhip and noble Anceſtors in my own and others Names, and to perform ſome ſmall ſervice to you in the Subject treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of.</p>
            <p>I am not unſenſible that ſuch a thredbare Argument (hardly any one thing having had more Authors) in ſuch a plain if not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times an offenſive Dreſs as a great part of it appears in, without the advantage of any Ornament, may ſeem ſomewhat an unſutable Preſent to your Honours. But as there are many things in it (as I think) not obſerved, and many not in ſuch manner delivered by others: ſo I know too that your Honours are not to learn from me that generally the moſt familiar and well known matters are truly of the greateſt and moſt conſtant uſe, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer plain and important Truths before that which is only fine and new. Beſides that ſo great Goodneſs as yours will not forget to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe me, by conſidering that the Perſons among whom I am now placed make it my moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Employment to explain and teach the moſt ordinary but uſeful Dutys of Religion; Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb facs="tcp:94938:3"/> at leaſt in the moſt plain and ſimple manner I can: and then ſo little prudence as my own ſerves to tell me that the place it ſelf may put me in mind of acknowledging in ſome mean way rather than none at all (my little leiſure and my very broken Health not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting me to do better at this time or perhaps hereafter) the great Bounty of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's illuſtrious Predeceſſors to the Church and Univerſity, to Religion and Learning (without doubt the two beſt things in the World) who were pleaſed to beſtow the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage of this Rectory and three other of plentiful Revenue upon the happy place of my many years thoughts. Your Lordſhips moſt advantageous Temper, great Capacity and happy Education under ſo virtuous and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Parent ſeem not to permit any departure from the ſame generous Inclinations. May others imitate them, eſpecially in this prophane and fooliſh Generation, in which true and uſeful Knowledge, Virtue, though wiſe and manly, Piety though generous and excellent are attempted to be trampled upon by ignorant and conceited Drollery, and not only an unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb facs="tcp:94938:4"/> but an unmanly Debauchery; which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much ſupports as the Dulneſs and Confidence of the Brutes that practiſe it.</p>
            <p>Theſe either, they know not how to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Superſtition (an ignorant Fear and Zeal) from Religion, and to ſecure themſelves from the one without throwing away the other: or they gladly take Occaſion through the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret perſwaſion of their <hi>fooliſh and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Luſts</hi> from the former to do the latter. They must needs put away the Wheat with the Chaff, not only an ignorant and baſe fear but alſo the moſt reaſonable free and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous Reverence, Honour, Love and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their Maker, the moſt amiable and ſatisfying Object the Soul of Man can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and embrace; without whom we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be what we ſhould or would be; whom if we poſſeſs not by Contemplation, Love and Likeneſs to, we are either ſo little minded as never to enquire for, or ſo unhappy as in vain to endeavour after our most compleat Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Felicity.</p>
            <p>As for ſome ſmall Service which I propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to my ſelf of performing to your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
<pb facs="tcp:94938:4"/> I hope it was not without ſome reaſon. Some of the Contents of the enſuing Treatiſe may not be altogether uncapable of it; and I have not had the Honour and Happineſs of Converſe with any Perſons of your Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Age and Sex who are more able to judge of what is true and profitable, or better diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to make uſe of it. Thoſe who know your Honours will eaſily make the perſonal appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. And yet (Madam) I humbly beg your Leave to be but in one word ſo juſt as to let others know as well as my ſelf that your natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Parts, your acquired Learning, your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet Piety and Virtue, your obliging Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs are ſuch as moreover render you the just Aemulation and Pattern of all of your Sex and honourable Condition and me in particular (as I alſo am your Lordſhip's)</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>AFter all the vaſt and not unpleaſant ramble that the mind of Man may take through the Univerſe, it muſt at laſt ſet down content (and well it may) with the Knowledge and Practice of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> as the poſſeſſion of the greateſt good it is capable of: The plain end and ſum of which is to fear and honour God ſo as to keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of loving him above all things, and our Neighbour as our ſelves, and therefore our ſelves; that is, willing and rejoycing in the greateſt Happineſs of all Beings exiſtent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered together as one Body, and therefore of each Particular ſo as is effective of the greateſt happineſs of the whole. For by Religion (of the Object not Religion of the Subject or Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs) I mean nothing elſe but a Syſtem of Doctrines made known from God to Men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their Duty, or concerning other Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which may be any way means or helps to
<pb facs="tcp:94938:6"/> practiſe and obſerve it. Theſe Doctrines may be made known either by our natural Faculties of invention and reaſoning, or by Revelation. Thoſe which are made known by our natural Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties with which we are born may be called na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Religion. As for Example, That Good is to be willed; that therefore a greater good is to be willed more than a leſs, and the greateſt moſt of all: that is, the greateſt good as to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion, Extenſion and Duration is to be willed with the greateſt force and intenſeneſs of our Minds, and always. For by the ſame reaſon that good is to be willed by us, the greateſt is ſo too: nor is the propriety of any thing but the goodneſs of it the only reaſon why it is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our will. In few words, <hi>That the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt good of the whole Univerſe in reſpect of Intenſion and Duration be the ultimate Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our Wills always either immediately or mediately actually or habitually, and not that of any part and therefore not of our ſelves.</hi> In which one Doctrine is all formal Virtue contained, and from it are all particular Virtues eaſily deduced. This is the firſt and great Law of Nature, or which is invented or judged true by our natural reaſon. 1. Plainly like as in the animal body or rather the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded creature man (that we may comprehend the nature of Virtue by a moſt eaſie ſimilitude) all the functions and operations of each particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar member are ſuppoſed to be performed not for
<pb facs="tcp:94938:6"/> its own or any other member's proper good but for the greateſt good of the whole body, or rather of the whole man; in which their won too ſo far as it is conſtitutive or any way effective thereof, is neceſſarily included; ſo very eaſie and obvious is the confutation of all thoſe falſe ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtems or hypotheſes of morality which make vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to conſiſt in all our dutys to be deduced from <hi>ultimate ſelf-love.</hi> The vaſt and moſt univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal importance of this truth and its not being yet ſo commonly minded as it ſhould, may, I hope, be a ſufficient excuſe for the ſeeming importune and unneceſſary mentioning and interpoſing of it in the following Treatiſe. Add to this thoſe other as they are ordinarily called <hi>Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> Such as are that God or an all-perfect Being is to be worſhipped, that is, honoured, prayed to, be obeyed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that we ought not to make happy the wicked nor unhappy the righteous or thoſe who will and endeavour the moſt publick or univerſal good, that we ought to be beneficent, grateful to our Benefactors, and particularly to Parents, and ſcores the like. All which are nothing elſe but ſuch Diſpoſitions and Actions which by Reaſon or Experience have been found and concluded to have more good Effects than their contraries, or than their Omiſſion, or to be moſt for the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal and common good: and are indeed Rules or Directions for our Prudence. 2. (As are generally the voluminous reſolutions of thoſe which are called caſes of Conſcience) to obtaine the
<pb facs="tcp:94938:7"/> ultimate End of all our Wills and Actions, <hi>viz.</hi> the greateſt good of the Whole, in the willing of which E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Theſe, I ſay, and ſuch like Doctrines and Truths be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made known from God to the Minds of Men by their Faculties of Invention and Reaſoning with which he hath cauſed them to be born, are very well term<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But what can be more evident than that if <hi>ought</hi> be to preferred before <hi>ought not,</hi> if the greateſt Perfection and Felicity of the whole World, nay, of every particular Perſon be valuable and to be preferred before their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection and Miſery, It muſt be inſufferable Selfiſhneſs and Pride, together with deſirable Ignorance and Folly that muſt cauſe them to regard it without the greateſt Reverence and Love.</p>
            <p>And as for the Chriſtian Religion it is certain that in general all its Doctrines are ſo confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or at leaſt uncontradicted by the natural and Catholick Religion: and particularly all thoſe which concern our Duty are if rightly interpreted ſo perfectly ſuch, (not any being yet deprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or made good to be otherwiſe by the moſt witty and malicious, or wiſe, honeſt and unprejudiced) with ſo much aſſurance, ſimplicity and ſincerity delivered: Alſo all its other aſſiſtant Doctrines concerning God's Nature and Actions, Jeſus
<pb facs="tcp:94938:8"/> Chriſt the Meſſenger of it, good and bad Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, Man-kind, their Original, Nature, Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (This may be no inconvenient Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod for a Syſtem of Chriſtian Religion) are ſo truly uſeful to make Men the moſt perfectly vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and holy or to perform their Duty, ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to contemplate by reaſon of their ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and greatneſs, that it muſt needs be the moſt ſeriouſly and deliberatedly loved and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired by the wiſeſt and beſt men.</p>
            <p>One part of the Doctrines that all Religions contain is concerning that infinitely perfect Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called God; <hi>viz.</hi> his Nature, infinite Power, Wiſdom and Goodneſs; his Actions, Creation, Preſervation and Providence; and then our Duty towards him, which is in one word to Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him: that is to contemplate, honour, love, rejoyce, truſt in, deſire from, imitate, obey him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to ſignifie this by convenient ſigns.</p>
            <p>Among theſe our Dutys towards God one, <hi>viz. to love God for himſelf</hi> is a part or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Virtue or Univerſal Goodneſs, the reſt are Inſtruments or Means thereof.</p>
            <p>The Duty of Prayer ſo as is explained and deſcribed in the enſuing Treatiſe is not only to deſire and petition any thing from God: but contains all his Worſhip, nay it neceſſarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers all our Duty univerſally. Our ſolemn pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and reſolution of Obedience and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently Imitation of God (God having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb facs="tcp:94938:9"/> us to be like himſelf) which is one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient in a Prayer neceſſarily imports the practice of all our Duty whatſoever. For God is or hath commanded one way or other by natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Light or Revelation all we ought to be and do.</p>
            <p>The Nature and Uſes of this ordinary Duty are ſo particularly deſcribed in the Treatiſe it ſelf, that I ſhall not here add any thing but only that I hope they are ſo plain and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as to be underſtood and approved by all who are g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> principal part of which is the Converſation of Mens minds with God; the Imitation of his moſt perfect and happy Life to the utmoſt of our Power in the greateſt Knowledge and Virtue, Wiſdom and Goodneſs, Prudence and Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. Wherefore I cannot approve the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of many now adays who ſeem to make it the only End and Deſign of Government to increaſe Riches and People and Trade in a Nation, from whence they take all their Reaſons and Meaſures of all Laws and Conſtitutions. As if Men were made for nothing but to enjoy all the Conveniencies and gratifie all the Appetites of this preſent pitiful fleſhly Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, to eat, drink, enjoy Wives, Children and Relations, to live in Health, Strength, Eaſe, to be ſafe from all
<pb facs="tcp:94938:10"/> their Enemies, or to extend their Fame and Dominions abroad. Whereas in truth the whole Furniture of this bodily Life is but in order and ſhould be ſubſervient to the ſpiritual or intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual one, that we might live it with leſs inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption or diſturbance our ſelves, and propagate it in others, and there is nothing more plain than that the inordinate and immoderate grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of our bodily Appetites, or thoſe which are proper to this fleſhly Life, eſpecially ſenſual ones is the moſt inconſiſtent with a ſpiritual and virtuous Temper, and conſequently with the moſt <hi>perfect and happy</hi> Condition of Man-kind. Nor ſeems it much to be hoped to ſee the World in better Poſture till the Affairs thereof are otherwiſe ordered, or it ſhall pleaſe God more immediately by a larger Effuſion of his Holy Spirit, by his Power and Virtue upon the Souls of Men to frame, temper and diſpoſe them.</p>
            <p>A Second ſort of thoſe who are apt to think ſomewhat meanly of this religious Duty of Prayer, are the learned, who are moſt converſant in Science and addict themſelves to Speculation. Theſe oft-times very much neglect <hi>Practice,</hi> they little and ſeldom mind <hi>Morality,</hi> of which I reckon <hi>Piety</hi> or our Dutys towards God to be without compare the moſt excellent part. By how much the Objects of our Speculation are of a more different and remote nature from God (as are all corporeal things with their Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions)
<pb facs="tcp:94938:10"/> by how much they are more numerous and various, by how much they require a greater Intenſion of Spirit (as very ſubtil and profound things in the Mathematicks and Metaphyſicks:) So much the more ſtill do they draw away the Mind from Religion and Piety: inſomuch that the greateſt Scholars are not always the beſt Men. It is true indeed that ſome Knowledge where the Objects of it are intellectual (as that of our own Souls and the mutual Relations and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects of things) by ſpiritualizing our Minds doth prepare and diſpoſe us to apprehend and be affected with God: but then alſo by more vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly employing the Application of our Minds and more intenſely pleaſing them, it perhaps more effectually detains and with-holds us from Piety than our Converſe with ſenſible and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Objects. Nay, in Moral and Religious Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it ſelf it is not only poſſible but I believe very frequent for Men to be ſo inordinately and immoderately pleaſed, taken and in Love with the meer Knowledge or Speculation of the Objects thereof, as to have very little Care, Eſteem and Love for the Practice, or the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally having it in their own Hearts, that is, their Wills and Affections. They are altogether dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent things for a Man to perceive and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand and that very diſtinctly and clearly the Perfections of his Inclinations, Appetites and Affections, and to poſſeſs them or have them really in himſelf: to know all the Rules of <hi>Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:94938:11"/> and therefore of <hi>Piety,</hi> and to practiſe them. The one is a quality of the <hi>Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> the other of the <hi>Will and Affections.</hi> They have two different faculties and actions of the Soul for their Subjects, and therefore the one may be and full often is in the ſame Soul where there is nothing of the other; (though I acknowledge that <hi>uſually</hi> the beſt and cleareſt Knowledge of Humane Nature is from a Man's own Experience of himſelf, of which the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is obvious) and conſequently a Man may have one for the Object of his Eſteem and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and the other not at all. Nay, the more he minds and loves the one not in order to or for the ſake of the other, the leſs will he mind or love this other. In few and known Words meer <hi>Speculation</hi> even in Religion and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality may and moſt often doth more pleaſe Men than the <hi>Practice;</hi> and the more the one is for it ſelf prized and beloved, the leſs is the other. 'Tis like as when ſome unweildy or lame Perſon with much pleaſure conceives, deſcribes and teaches others the beſt Poſtures and Motions of Vaulting or Dancing who never was nor is able nor cared at all to perform them himſelf: or like Hunters who are only delighted with the finding and catching their Game but care not for eating it.</p>
            <p>But becauſe the Effects of Mens Science and Speculation are generally more or leſs beneficial and acceptable to the World. (Which is not ſo
<pb facs="tcp:94938:11"/> in their poſſeſſion of Honour, Riches or ſenſual Pleaſures) the immoderacy of the Appetite after it is not ſo much obſerved or blamed.</p>
            <p>Theſe Perſons are to be remembred th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t <hi>Morality</hi> of which as I ſaid <hi>Piety</hi> is incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably the moſt excellent part, is infinitely to be preferred before Speculation; a generous Vir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tue before Knowledge; the perfect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on of our Wills before that of our Underſtanding. For the firſt (as I have ſomewhere elſe had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to mention) being nothing but an habitual deſigning and intend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng in all our Actions the Univerſal Good, <hi>in its own Nature neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily</hi> tends only to an infinite good and is uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ver made otherwiſe by the will and power of God himſelf: the other <hi>barely and in its own Nature conſidered</hi> only delighteth our ſelves. Nay, not ſo much as that perhaps but only by God's Will. Speculation therefore is an idle and uſeleſs thing compared with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>And even in Speculation it ſelf, that which hath God a Being of Perfection unſearchable and incomprehenſible by any but himſelf for its Object, is incomparably the moſt raviſhing to the Soul of Man. And yet it is moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeen that every ſmall <hi>Speculator</hi> or <hi>Theor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt,</hi> a Philoſopher, Mathematician, Linguiſt, Critick, Politician and Theologers too, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Polemicks are very prone to deſpiſe and look down upon Piety and practical Religion as a
<pb facs="tcp:94938:12"/> great way below them; to leave them as ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary things ſit only for little and vulgar Minds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whilſt they are employed in Matters of higher Concern and Importance.</p>
            <p>The Third Sort of thoſe who hate or deſpiſe Piety and all Religious Dutys towards God are vicious and debauched perſons. Theſe do it often partly becauſe of their dulneſs, principally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Piety is inconſiſtent with the gratification of their Luſts: and particularly in Men of fierce, haughty and ſwelling Tempers, becauſe it is oppoſite to their Pride, becauſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines and controuls them, takes away their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, puts them in mind of their Meanneſs, placeth them in the ſame rank with the pooreſt of Mortals. For they affect Uncontroulable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Licentiouſneſs, they would be ſubject to none, acknowledge no Superior, would be and do only what they themſelves liſt, at leaſt have ſome priviledge above others. It is certainly inconſiſtent with ſuch Tempers to acknowledge God's infinite Superiority to themſelves and their entire Dependence upon his Will and Pleaſure, to deſire any thing from him with a humble reference of all their Petitions to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Wiſdom and Righteouſneſs; or to return any Thanks unto him, to own and pay the moſt juſt Tribute of Obedience as well as the meaneſt of his Creatures, to confeſs, diſown, deſpiſe or pity themſelves, be grieved for their unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Self-will and Diſobedience; to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb facs="tcp:94938:12"/> their Guilt and deſerved Puniſhment, and yet God's Right of Remiſſion upon their ſincere Repentance and their humble and important Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt; and that too for the ſake of another who was that which they have been ſhamefully defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in, (viz.) the moſt perfectly righteous and obedient: All theſe and ſuch like moſt juſt Dutys to our Maker theſe diſſolute licentious and proud Creatures muſt needs hate and deſpiſe as repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to their Luſts, controuling their Liberty and obliging them to the moſt ſenſible Reflection upon and Confeſſion of their Meanneſs and Baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Hence they<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l ſometimes deny or cavil at them, and the very Exiſtence of God himſelf, as much as their wit and care of their ſafety will give them leave. Or for want of theſe when they have little or nothing to ſay, and with them too, they'l huff at them, with a ſcornful piſh, throw them away and neglect them as a Cheat or at leaſt a thing uncertain and trouble ſome. Thoſe who are governed by a Belief of God and Duty towards him they pretend to look upon as weak, of no Parts or Wit, timorous, ſuperſtitious, little and low minded, whilſt they conceit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeves to be great Spirits and noble Souls indeed.</p>
            <p>Alas for them! goodly things indeed they are! To whom in ſhort it is to be anſwered, that it is a wicked thing to affect to have what they ſhould not, and as ſilly to deſire what they cannot obtain. It is a wicked and unreaſonable thing for thee to deſire thy Liberty from the Direction and
<pb facs="tcp:94938:13"/> Government of him who is infinitely better and wiſer than thy ſelf; who is infinitely good, and immutably delights in the effecting of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt good of the whole Univerſe, and is infinitely wiſe and infallibly knows what doth effect it; who knows and can do all things, upon whom are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent all the Natures and Exiſtences of things poſſible to be; who therefore hath all the right that can be conceived to be the Law-giver of the Univerſe. If thou or any the moſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed and perfect Being beſides himſelf comply not with or conform not to his Will, thou canſt not be innocent, but thou muſt be he who prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thy own ſelf before the whole Univerſe, and haſt in thee that Inſolence to deſire that all may miniſter to thy Pleaſure: than which what can be more prodigiouſly unreaſonable wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt: But if it be reaſonable to be obedient to and to be like God becauſe he will and commands all for the Univerſal good, then is it alſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable that we ſhould perform all other Dutys of <hi>Piety</hi> to him (Acknowledgment and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of his Perfectins. Honour, Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Thankfulneſs, Confeſſion of and Grief for our Tranſgreſſion of his Laws, &amp;c.) which diſpoſe and cauſe us to obey and imitate him</p>
            <p>Nor are theſe ſwaggering Hectors leſs fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh than wicked. For whether they will or no they ought to be and ſhall be what God willeth. All things that are any thing really exiſtent
<pb facs="tcp:94938:13"/> muſt be the Effects of his Will, and dependent upon him who is Infinitely Perfect, for otherwiſe he is not ſo. All that he wills concerning us, is either what we ſhould be (the due Relations of our Actions to their Objects) or what we ſhall be: the one is ordinarily termed his Commands, the other his Decrees. Now what God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, whether we think or will ſo or no, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly our Duty: we cannot alter the due Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our Actions to their Objects, no more than we can conceive that God will ever do it. And ſo our preſent and ſuture Condition are and ſhall be what he decrees or appoints. The good or evil things we at preſent enjoy or ſuffer from the leaſt to the greateſt, are and muſt be all from him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we will acknowledge or ask or deprecate or thank him for them or no. Our future State of unſpeakable Happineſs or Miſery after a ſhort time ſhall be by his Sentence, which ſhall be paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon us without our leave according as we have obſerved or violated his Commands, for all our affectation of Liberty and even Superiority. We be lawleſs? We the Governors and Judges of the World? What Sottiſhneſs is it in Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals or any Creatures to affect ſuch things which are neither fit nor poſſible? Nor is it at all a ſign of a <hi>great Mind</hi> to arrogate and aſpire to ſuch things for its own ſelf, not abiding it any where elſe; but rather of a ſtingy and contracted one, which refers all to it ſelf though never ſo little and contemptible.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:94938:14"/>
            <p>No <hi>Selſiſhneſs</hi> can be great, except in him who is at leaſt virtually <hi>all</hi> himſelf, and upon whom all other Being and Happineſs neceſsarily depend. A great Mind is equally pleaſed with the exiſtence of Infinite Perfection (and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of the greateſt Happineſs in the World either fit or poſſible) in any other as well as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. It is indifferent to him where it be, ſo it be: he is infinitely in Love with it and rejoyceth in it: he deſpiſeth and hateth ſuch a <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per as to wiſh it no where, becauſe it is not in himſelf.</p>
            <p>Wherefore there is nothing more inexcuſable, more odious and deſpicable than a licentious and proud and conſequently a negligent ungrateful diſobedient Creature towards God his and all the World's Maker and Univerſal Benefactor. To ſee Ignorance, Folly and Wickedneſs exalt it ſelf againſt Infinite Wiſdom and Goodneſs, and a pitiful Worm to wriggle his dirty Body, and turn up his contemptible Snout againſt Heaven, meer Impotency and Weakneſs which cannot ſtand of it ſelf to ſtrutt againſt Almighty Power: To ſee him defying and huffing at God, who muſt by and by ly ſprawling and grunting, and ſuffer himſelf to be inſulted over by every Fly and Worm: What can more move Indignation, Contempt, or Pity?</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Creatures too who have made Religion and Piety, the Worſhip of their Maker, a Droll and Jeſt. Who have not only hated them,
<pb facs="tcp:94938:14"/> but endeavoured to render them the Objects of their Contempt. A thing very eaſie to do. There is not the moſt excellent thing that may not be repreſented contemptible and ridiculous. For it is but obſerving ſomething therein or related to it, which compared with others greater is really mean and ſmall, or made to appear ſo: but to conceal what is truly great in it; as its being the cauſe of ſome ſmall effect compared with others greater, or being like to ſomething that is mean and contemptible. And in this conſiſts the whole Art of <hi>Drollery.</hi> Nor there is nothing which hath not ſome ſuch things belonging to it. Even God himſelf (with Reverence be it ſpoken) may by an Atheiſtical l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now the Paſſions of Hatred and Contempt (as all other Paſſions) naturally farniſh the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:94938:15"/> or cauſe to come to mind thoſe things which maintain them and that is any miſchievous Quality or Imperfection: but they keep back or conceal any thing that may abate them.

But would one ever have thought that that which ſignifies ſomething appertaining to our Duty to our Maker ſhould have been ſo? Or that it ſhould not be deemed the moſt honourable Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Condition, to be a Servant to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely Great, Wiſe, and good Soveraign of the Univerſe? In the mean time they may aſſure themſelves that there are ſome ſuch ſaithful Servants of God, who are ſo ſenſible thereof as to contemn and hate ſuch degenerate Souls be they as big as they will, ſo far as they are the
<pb facs="tcp:94938:15"/> Cauſes or Subjects of ſuch Impiety; and yet ſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riouſly to pity them as capable of better things. Wiſe and vertuous Souls as much deſpiſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt hectoring Vice (though I ſay with deep com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion for the Perſons) as it can Religion and Piety.</p>
            <p>Nor is this humour but too much among the rich and great only, but (as is uſual) the faſhion is followed by the inferiour ſort. And it is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary enough for them to think that they have wit and worth enough to deſpiſe Religion and the Prieſt. And although the Office if it be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For the bad examples of thoſe who adminiſter it, do a great deal of harm; and yet their good ones do little good. If they miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demean themſelves (which cannot be too ſeldom) their faults are magnified and publiſhed with no good intent, but out of Envy, Contemptuouſneſs, or to juſtifie and excuſe mens own licentiouſneſs: But if they demean themſelves never ſo worthily and blameleſsly, as if they only were by way of puniſhment bound to their good behaviour; their good example is little heeded, and leſs imitated. I think there are no Perſons in a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth who better deſerve what may be eſteemed
<pb facs="tcp:94938:16"/> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But all this will little cool or abate the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires and Reſolutions of a ſincerely and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly virtuous Soul. Which although it knows very well what reward Virtue deſerves for its Maintenance and Encouragement, and is well aſſured that how little ſoever it receives here (which it doth not much prize or envy) it ſhall not want what is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Some of the ſeeming cauſes ſomewhat more particular and remote of the Neglect, Hatred, and Contempt of <hi>Piety,</hi> beſides that Univerſal one, the Pityable, Natural Inep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n, and what hath been before obſerved, may be ſome ſuch as theſe. Which I crave leave with all due Deference and ſubmiſſion to wiſer ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers but juſt to mention. Some want of Education of Perſons deſigned for the Clergy in
<pb facs="tcp:94938:16"/> ſerious and intelligent Piety; want of longer continuance in places allotted for that purpoſe, and of more careful examination of ſit Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations before they are admitted to that Office: Want of more places for Retirement and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, where Men may learn to rectifie their Opinions, to Moderate and Govern their Paſſions, to Direct, Form, and Temper their Inclinations: Want of ſufficiency of Revenue for the ſufficient and deſerving Officers of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in very many Places, and eſpecially in almoſt all Corporations where their work is, and their worth ſhould be the greateſt, and there is moſt need, not only of Artificial but Natural Authority. Their Revenue alſo, eſpecially ſince Religion in general and the National Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline in particular is ſo much neglected and ſlighted, conſiſting in moſt places of many and ſmall things is too ſolicitous and contentious. Their number likewiſe, both of Superiour and Inferiour ſort ſeems to be too ſmall, with us probably, computing the whole Nation, there will not be found above 5 or 6 Hundred, but in moſt Corporations and populous Towns, one to two, three or four Thouſand. And in ſome Proteſtant-Countreys, and particularly our next Neighbours, though they are a conſtituted Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, and flouriſh in Riches and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Yet I conjecture in ſome Cities, there is not one Clergy Man to five or ſix Thouſand, I ſpeak of their National Church, not of their
<pb facs="tcp:94938:17"/> Diſſenters. I know there are ſome Lay-Elders as they call them, which may be ſome help to them. And this may be one cauſe of the increaſe both of Papiſts, and other diſſenters amongſt them (if it be true as hath been ſaid) notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the advantages which thoſe of their National Church enjoy. But in thoſe places where the Romiſh Religion obtains, as in <hi>Italy, Spain</hi> and <hi>France</hi> (in which laſt, I have ſome ground for my Conjecture) there may be about one to twenty or thirty. And in the Divine conſtitution of the Jewiſh Common-wealth, we know one whole Tribe was aſſigned for the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of Religion, or Gods Worſhip; which might be then about a Fourtieth part of the whole people: And yet their Offices and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, if they be conſidered, will I think be ſound to require much leſs time and leiſure, than thoſe which are incumbent upon the Clergy in the Chriſtian Church.</p>
            <p>It is true, he may be of opinion that their number is already rather too great who ſeems to make that their only uſe and employment, which is ſometimes but the ſmalleſt part of it, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſpeak to about a Thouſand Perſons at once, being as many as can conveniently hear in one place; though I think, if only that were performed as frequently and as well as would be beſt, it would require a greater number. Add to theſe the great neglect and even conculcation of Teel ſiaſtical Diſcipline both over Clergy and Lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb facs="tcp:94938:17"/> eſpecially in Manners. To which I heartily wiſh there were not too great Encouragement in the Civil Government, by the Neglect of the Execution of its own very ſage and ſober Laws, and the undoing Examples of thoſe who are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with it. <note n="*" place="margin">Omne animi vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium tanto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectius in ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Crimen habet quanto is qui pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat major habetur.</note> The neglect alſo of the Religious Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Families thoſe little Commonwealths of which the greater are compoſed, may be here reckoned. The Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of judicious, plain, and affectionate Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and Application of the Chriſtian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, or of <hi>Preaching.</hi> ſeems a very fit and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Means for the Propagation and Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Piety, as all Popular Orations, are for the Maintenance of the Eſteem and Practice of any Opinions or Actions. For whatever ſome pleaſe to think, ſo long as the nature of Man is what it is now, and they purſue all other things beſides Religion, with ſuch real and mighty paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions as they do: If they be not frequently paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionated for Religion and Piety too, it ſeems not likely that it ſhould ever <hi>Naturally</hi> be preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in the World. What God may otherwiſe do we know not.</p>
            <p>If men would have not great affections in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, they muſt alſo bring Men to have none in other Affairs, or elſe they will betray it to looſe all its command and efficacy; but only there where men are little or nothing concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
<pb facs="tcp:94938:18"/> Of this the Romaniſts, eſpecially in <hi>France,</hi> ſeem very ſenſible, and therefore in ſome places are very diligent in preaching, but eſpecially zealous even beyond their Adverſaries: where their Auditors in their capital City (for other places I know little) are ſo numerous and attentive, that their Preaching and Catechiſing ſeemed to me the principal cauſe of the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of their Church among the people, and that were it not for them, their Maſs and all the reſt of their pompous Religion would not keep the beſt, if not the moſt of their Sheep from run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning out into their Neighbours paſture if both Gates were ſet open. This Preaching muſt not be like School-Boys Themes, or young Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micks Orations, or School-Lectures, But ſuch diſcourſe as is commonly uſed in the greateſt Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of humane life (not comparably ſo great as the reforming Mens manners and ſaving their Souls) as at the Bar, in the Senate; in ſerious and uſeful private Converſation: where men ſpeak in good earneſt to inform, convince and perſwade their Auditors. And becauſe the generality of men through the want of ability or good will, mind not ſo much Religious matters as the concerns of this life, it muſt be oftimes performed to do any great good with many, even ſtudied or allowed defects: which to ſome more witty than prudent for want of experience, and who think others too much like themſelves, may ſeem contemptible. It muſt be oftimes
<pb facs="tcp:94938:18"/> done with frequent Repetitions and Inculca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, many homely Similitudes, many moſt eaſie and obvious Inferences and general Prooſs: or elſe the greateſt part of Auditors, and even of thoſe who are of good underſtanding in other Affairs, will never take the pains themſelves to mind, underſtand, remember or be affected with what is delivered.</p>
            <p>For the frequency of the performance of this Office, it ſeems neceſſary to augment the number of thoſe who are to diſcharge it, that ſo it might be done the better. The too often and frequent performance of it by one Perſon doth cauſe it to be done generally very meanly, and injudiciouſly, ſometimes very coldly and dryly, and ſometimes with a great deal of non-ſenſe and noiſe, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the place of ſound Senſe and diſcreet Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: In ſumn, oftimes to little and ſometimes to had purpoſe. Nor is it long ſince that this very mean performance of Preaching, was one prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal cauſe why the Office was ſo ſhamefully inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by every one who had a hot Head and great Lungs, with ſuch ſucceſs, as to be thought by themſelves and the people too, to be as good Preachers as the beſt; and even to be inſpired. For how elſe (thought they) could illiterate men Extempore equalize and exceed thoſe who had the advantage of Education and Study.</p>
            <p>And as it may be of great uſe to multiply and encourage, accommodate and fit Inſtructers of the People: So it ſeems neceſsary that there
<pb facs="tcp:94938:19"/> ſhould be ſome of more ſpeculative calm and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till, and others of more prudent Tempers, who ſhould be the Judges and Determiners of the Truth of Doctrine and the Expediency of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. For neither theſe Popular nor yet more Courtly Orators are uſually ſo ſit for that: though generally they are apt to take it upon them, and often have done it, deſpiſing the other Sort of Perſons of fitter Qualities for it. They have much more pleaſed and been more applauded by the Generality of Men than the other; whence they have not only judged themſelves in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, more deſerving and valuable (which may be oft-times) but particularly more fit to be Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors and Directors, which hath ſeldom proved ſo. For commonly as they are Perſons of great and it may be good Paſſions: ſo they are but of general confuſed and narrow Appre henſion, and oft-times of too much employment; and beſides extraordinarily prejudiced by the frequency of their Zeal and other Paſſions to judge things true and great which are often not ſo. It ſeems certain they are very excellent and uſeful Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but not ſo fit to be the uppermoſt Maſters and Governors. And we ſee Men ſenſible of this in Civil and Secular Matters; where every Haranguer is not thought ſit to be a Judge or Privy Counſellor. Finally it is to be heartily wiſhed and endeavoured without the leaſt envy or contention, that every one might have Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and juſt Encouragement to make uſe of his
<pb facs="tcp:94938:19"/> Talent greater or leſs in the Church of God and every where elſe for his Maſter's Service the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of good. And as to direct and improve it for that End is every Man's greateſt Perfection, ſo it is we know the only Condition of his Reward.</p>
            <p>But many of theſe things and many more ſeen in this our Age, to be rather wiſhed by thoſe who Cordially deſire the Propagation of Religion, than hoped that they ſhould be ſo much as taken into Conſideration. However, we may and ought by our humble &amp; importunate Petition perpetually ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the Great King and Lord of all things, that he would without or with what Means he pleaſeth erect his Kingdom in the Hearts of Rebellious Mortals, and diſpoſe their Souls to a free Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his Laws howſoever promulated or made known.</p>
            <p>As for the following <hi>Treatiſe</hi> to which this ſomewhat long <hi>Preface</hi> leads, It pretends to no great Matters: The Subject of it being the moſt common and beaten in our own Tongue, and a great part of it compoſed at firſt for a very plain Auditory; it cannot be expected but that a great many things which Occur therein ſhould be ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary well known and more vulgarly expreſſed in a dreſs ſuitable to it, and probably with too many little defects of ſtyle left hanging about them. Nor is it fit that in a Treatiſe of the whole argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they ſhould be emitted, provided they be but true and profitable though but to meaner capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Nevertheleſs I think I ſhall not be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken
<pb facs="tcp:94938:20"/> in ſaying that there are in it many things of good Importance not at all obſerved, many not ſo diſtinctly, many not ſo much with their reſpective Reaſons delivered by others.</p>
            <p>If it ſhould be otherwiſe, and there ſhould be no valuable difference between this and other Diſcourſes of the ſame Subject in our Tongue: yet it might not be altogether ſuperfluous. For this might fall into the Hands of ſome and be read by them for ſome Conſideration or other, when others would not. I look upon ſuch Books as many Shops of the ſame Trade which ſell the ſame Commodities.</p>
            <p>Though one might be ſufficient to furniſh all Buyers if they would come thither: yet many would omit their own Conveniencies and never buy at all, if there were not others nearer hand or in their way, or belonging to ſome Friend or Acquaintance.</p>
            <p>Finally, if it ſhould happen that the ſame things may be had elſewhere better and with more advantage, I ſhall be ſeriouſly glad of it; and much more pleaſed at ſuch a reaſon of my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, than troubled at my Miſtake it ſelf. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it was thought beſt to err on the ſafeſt hand, and conſidered, that Superfluity doth leſs Harm than Want. I pray God it may be ſomewhat ſerviceable to his Honour and the good of Men.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94938:26"/> and the future State. As in that great minded Diſcourſe of Jeſus's to his Diſciples concerning Divine Providence (<hi>Matt.</hi> 6.) where it ſeems to be wondred at that Men ſhould be ſo ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous and careful concerning the Neceſſities or Conveniencies of this preſent Life, when there was ſo eaſie and certain a way undoubtedly to obtain and ſecure them: <hi>viz.</hi> by being firſt the faithful Subjects and Servants of God, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly at that time as ſending his Laws and Commands by Jeſus himſelf, or by being ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Chriſtians. That it was not to be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the leaſt but that God would provide for and take Care of his Servants in thoſe reſpects ſo much as was for their Good. And again, if they ſhould want them, and have evil things befal them, and undergo Afflictions; even this ſhall certainly be for their good: <hi>For all things work together for the good of thoſe who love God.</hi> And as to the future Life, the State after Death, and the Diſſolution of our Bodies into Duſt and Vapour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what great and magnificent things are told and aſſured us? ſuch as were never known at all, or not with any Certainty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively conſiderable before. A State ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and happy is promiſed, that nothing leſs than Glory and Crowns, and Kingdoms, and Joy and Life, the moſt admired and eſteemed things among us, are uſed to repreſent and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie it. And all this upon the Condition of our preparations for it, by thoſe holy Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94938:26"/> in our Souls, of Righteouſneſs, of Love to the Univerſe at once, or as one, to God and to every Creature, that it may be as perfect and happy, as is conſiſtent with the greateſt Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the Whole (which is beſt known to infinite Wiſdom) of Self-denial, of perfect Mortification of Luſts, that is, of the <hi>Inordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> and <hi>Immoderacy</hi> of all our Appetites. And yet further, that impotent Men may obtain theſe, the Conditions of all our other promiſed Happineſs both here and hereafter, God hath abſolutely promiſed us his Influence upon us for our Aſſiſtance to be, and Comfort in being ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and good, his Pardon and Forgiveneſs for the moſt eminent and illuſtrious Merits and Death of Jeſus, of all our paſt ſins and faults, when we are become good.</p>
                  <p>Among theſe, one very comprehenſively comfortable, as well as profitable Doctrine, is that which is taught concerning Prayer; (<hi>viz.</hi>) that all things, both thoſe of the future and of this Life too, if good for us, and it be reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and juſt that they ſhould be particularly granted us; that is, if it be for the greateſt good of the whole Univerſe, of which God is the Maker, Suſtainer, and Governour (and to be ſo diſpoſed, as never to deſire any thing otherwiſe, is our own Perfection, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently muſt needs be more joyous and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, than the contrary Diſpoſition of unjuſt-Slefiſhneſs) I ſay, all ſuch things may upon our
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94938:27"/> Requeſt, ſuch as it ought to be, be obtained. Upon which account we are not only adviſed, but commanded to lay aſide every where all Solicitude, all anxious Care, uſing only calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and cheerfully the juſt Prudence and Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, which we may judge the Goodneſs of every thing to deſerve, and dutifully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending our Deſires, and the Succeſs of our Endeavours to God, and perfectly acquieſcing in the Event, be it what it will. So is the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Precept, <hi>Philip. 4. v. 6. Be careful for nothing, but in every thing by Prayer and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication with Thankſgiving, let your Requeſt be made known unto God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whether we in general implore the Divine Favour and Good-Will, and conſequently the Forgiveneſs of our paſt Miſcarriages, and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of his Laws; or whether we beg his gracious Aſſiſtance, to make us holy and good, and by this means capable of all the other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of his Bounty; Whether more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly we deſire any excellent Ornament or Qualification of Soul, of Knowledge or Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Gift or Grace, as uſually called; Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our dull and confuſed Heads want Light and Clearneſs for the Diſcovery of Truth, or we would have the manifold unruly diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Motions and Appetites of our Minds to be tamed, abated, and at our due Command, and our Breathings and Endeavours after Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and Virtue excited and increaſed.

In a word, In all things whether they be little or ſmall, and the moſt inconſiderable, as not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing below God to take notice of; or they be great, and of the moſt valuable Conſequence, as not being too big for God Almighty to grant or bring to paſs, it is but making known hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly our Requeſt to God, and if our Deſires be good for us, and conſiſtent with God's Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the World, or with the Univerſal Good (and we are mad and wicked Men if we put not in that Exception) we need not in any of theſe things be careful or ſolicitous, but be confident we ſhall not fail of Audi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>FIrſt, What is <hi>Prayer,</hi> &amp;c. By <hi>Prayer</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moſt ſtrictly may be meant nothing but a Deſire ſignified unto God, that he would grant or beſtow ſome good thing upon us; which may be either poſitive or privative, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that he would give us the Poſſeſſion of ſome good thing, or the Security or Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from ſome evil thing; both which are
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94938:30"/> good things. To ſignifie this our Deſire unto God, needs no more than to conceive the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire in our Souls; for God knows every Thought of our Hearts, every Motion of Soul, as ſoon as ever it is exiſtent. He that made and ſuſtains the Soul in Being, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is always intimately preſent therewith cannot be ignorant of all that is in it.

                     </gap> Conceptions of the Things we pray for, or to promote our Affections, with which they may be conjoyn'd, and for ſome other Reaſons.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Prayer</hi> generally ſignifies many ſuch ſingle Deſires or Prayers, put and compoſed together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the other uſual Additions, which are commonly called Parts of Prayer. Thoſe are ordinarily ſaid to be Confeſſion and Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving; ſo that a Prayer is made to conſiſt of three ſorts of Parts, (<hi>viz.</hi>) Confeſſion, Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Thankſgiving. But there is no reaſon to confine a Prayer to theſe Parts only, there may be other things as uſefully and properly introduced; ſuch as are Profeſſion of our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and of our Reſolutions to be good for the time to come, the devoting our ſelves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, the expreſs Acknowledgment and Belief of the Divine Perfections and Excellencies, the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94938:30"/> propoſal or calling to Mind the reaſons of our Deſires, and the ground of our Hopes, that they ſhall be fulfilled and performed. Finally, in general, any other Thing which may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and augment our Deſire and Longing for what we would have, which Deſire is the very Eſſence of <hi>Prayer;</hi> and this is the very general reaſon, why in a <hi>Prayer</hi> all of them, are to be introduced and admitted thereinto ſome more nearly, ſome more remotely. And hence we may eaſily Judg what is proper, and what is more or leſs impertinent thereto, that is, what doth and what doth not, and what doth more or leſs than another thing in its place obtain this End.</p>
                  <p>Some of the Things which are pertinent Parts of Prayer, may be theſe,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, An expreſs Attention and Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of the Divine Perfections and Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>but<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And this not for God's ſake, that he might know them more diſtinctly, or the like, but for our own; that we might more adequately and diſtinctly, and longer attend to our own Neceſſities and Wants, our own impotent and mean and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Condition, and conſequently more earneſtly deſire Relief; of which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>

                  <p>1. THerefore an expreſs Acknowledgment of, and Attention to the Divine Perfections and Attributes, to attribute and aſcribe them to God, that is, to Judge them to be in God. Such as are</p>
                  <p>1. His infinite Power, that he is abſolutely able to do any thing what he pleaſeth, and this at all times, and that he is uncontroulable; none is ſuperiour to him, to hinder or reſtrain him, nor that he needs any other thing or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but can do all things without them, and even they are all dependent upon him, all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly at his Command, ſubject to his Will and Pleaſure, even the higheſt and moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Creature. So far as we deny, or doubt,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94938:31"/> or are not aſſured of this, or do not take it for granted, ſo far it would cauſe us to Judge it impoſſible or leſs probable that our Deſire ſhould be effected; and this will either quite extinguiſh or flatten our Deſire: for no Man ever ſurely deſires what he Judgeth an Impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility. And as for that which he hath no more reaſon to judge he may than he may not obtain by his Prayer, moſtwhat he will not trouble himſelf about it, much leſs ſtill about what he judgeth leſs probable. Or if he may venture a Prayer, as it were, it will be moſtwhat very coldly, and not often: or in general, the Prayers will be ſuch whoſe Pains are not more than the Probability of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, An Acknowledgment of his Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite All-comprehending Knowledg. That all things paſt, preſent and to come, poſſible and impoſſible, are always preſent to his Infinite Mind &amp; Underſtanding; that therefore he always know's what's abſolutely beſt to be done, or for the Univerſal Good, and therefore Juſt; and that when any Deſire or Prayer is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded unto him, he can never be ignorant or doubt whether it be to be granted or not, and how far, and therefore cannot upon that account refrain or delay; as we know it may be in the wiſeſt of Men, nay in the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of finite Creatures, Saints and Angels, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it ſhould be revealed to us that God would

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94938:33"/> and holy, this deters us therefrom, leſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being heard, we ſhould be puniſhed for this our Inſincerity or Hypocriſie. For Men know, that <hi>the Sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord, how much more when he bringeth it with a wicked Mind.</hi> Nay, the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of the Divine Wiſdom in our Prayers, engageth us not only to Sincerity of Intention in our Prayers, but to an univerſal Holineſs. So far forth as we are conſcious to our ſelves, of our ſincere Deſires to be good, ſo much more is our Confidence in God, and conſequently our Deſires more heightned: But ſo far as we know any Sin in our ſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged, allowed, approved, neglected to be reformed, ſo much leſs reaſon and confidence we ſhall have, that God will hear us, or be good to us in any kind, when we expreſly mind our ſelves that God ſeeth and knoweth it. How dareſt thou that haſt vile Thoughts, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, Affections, Inclinations, ſecret Actions, all as well known to God, as if they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the Meridian Sun, ask any thing of him, or ſo much as think of him? And ſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou not fear, that he ſhould puniſh thee for thy Impudence and Diſhonour thou doeſt him?</p>
                  <p>3. An Acknowledgment of the Divine <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Goodneſs</hi> or Righteouſneſs, which in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect is all one; his always doing that, which is for the greateſt <hi>Perfection</hi> and <hi>Happineſs</hi> of all
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94938:33"/> that he hath made conſidered together. This gives us Aſſurance (and conſequently em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldens our Deſires) that every thing that is <hi>righteous</hi> and <hi>juſt</hi> (a Condition we are always to remember in our Prayers) ſhall be effected and granted. And here we may take notice of the two Branches (for ſo they are) of his univerſal Goodneſs or Righteouſneſs, <hi>viz.</hi> his <hi>Juſtice,</hi> properly ſo called, and his <hi>Mercy.</hi> The firſt is the Method of effecting the <hi>Univerſal Good,</hi> by permiſſion and in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The good uſe of the former is, as hath been ſaid, to engage us to all ſincerity and purity of Heart, when we approach him with our Prayers and Deſires. For he is ſo good to the World, that when he ſees fit, he will alſo certainly puniſh wicked perſons and ſinners; which may be ſometimes by taking away what they have already received and enjoy; but much more by the denial of their Petitions for any thing they want. And ſo likewiſe God s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nercy engageth us to be good, if we would have ſo great a favour from him as the granting our Petitions. For God is no more merciful, than he is juſt, at random: but ſo as is for the beſt government of the World, or for the greateſt good thereof and therefore he is principally ſo to thoſe who are good, to thoſe who obey and ſerve him. God indeed may ſometimes ſee it good to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94938:34"/> good things upon bad men: but it is very little probable that he ſhould give to a bad man any particular good thing becauſe asked by him at any particular time. Nay the contrary is far more probable; <hi>viz.</hi> That he ſhould deny and reject his petition as a ſign of his juſt diſpleaſure againſt him. And this the conſciences of wicked men very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten let them know, and make them afraid and aſhamed to ſend up the leaſt deſire to God; or if they do, 'tis with a ſtrange faintneſs and indifferency, as if they little hoped it ſhould be accepted and return with ſucceſs. Moreover, God's mercy (as hath been ſaid of his univerſal goodneſs or righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs) gives us particular aſſurance of his granting our deſires for any thing that is good for us, if it be juſt and conſiſtent with or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of his <hi>univerſal Goodneſs,</hi> or his goodneſs to the whole World. That he is not tyrannical, imperious, cruel, envious to the meaneſt of his creatures: but that every thing which can and ought to be done, ſhall be done for us. Now the expreſs belief here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of together with his infinite Wiſdom and Power begets in us aſſured hope and truſt for the granting our juſt Prayers, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently enlivens and encourages them. And in ſome caſes God himſelf hath told us, that it is juſt for him to hear our Prayers; as when we pray for pardon of ſin for Chriſt's ſake
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94938:34"/> upon our ſincere repentance, and for grace to repent: Things of ſo great conſequence to us that we need not be much ſolicitous concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any other. Where we have not the certain aſſurance of the juſtice of our deſires we muſt only propoſe them with reference to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine wiſdom: As it is in the caſe of Health, Riches, Honour, Parts, Gifts, nay all inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of power or ability to do any thing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, unleſs it can any where appear to us, that God hath by Revelation or Reaſon in ſome particular caſes promiſed them to us.</p>
                  <p>And here it may be uſeful and proper to reflect upon the ſeveral ways or inſtances of God's Mercy, as they are alſo of his Power and Wiſdom: ſuch as his making, ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, providing for all his Creatures in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, his affording Means, Helps, and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtances of being <hi>good</hi> and <hi>wiſe,</hi> and keeping Men from being bad; the external ones of Direction, Inſtruction, Example; the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of the immediate Influences of his Spirit upon Mens Underſtandings, Conſciences, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, Inclinations; God's forbearance and long-ſuffering till Men do repent, which may be more eſpecially taken notice of; And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, all or any (more particularly as occaſion may be) the Conveniencies, Commodities, good things of this Life, as Health, Strength, Plenty, good-Name, Friends, Deliverance from Evils or Dangers, all which will ſtill
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94938:35"/> more evidently prove to us, and cauſe us longer to attend to, and more clearly to ſee, and more ſenſibly and ſtrongly to be affected with the divine Mercy and Bounty: That indeed the <hi>Lord is good to all, and his tender mercies are over all his works:</hi> That he is <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, gracious, long-ſuffering, and abundant in goodneſs and truth.</hi> If God be not good, whence are theſe and all other good things to the World? Since God is infinitely power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and knowing to do what he pleaſeth, what can be the cauſe, beſides his goodneſs, that there is any thing in the World but the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treameſt miſery? Hence conſequently our Faith (that is, our Belief and Truſt) and then our Deſires will be ſtrengthened and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldned.</p>
                  <p>Here too we may make a Reflection upon God's Veracity or his Goodneſs in perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Promiſes, which in the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> is very often called by the Names of <hi>Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs</hi> and <hi>Truth.</hi> We may reflect generally upon God's Goodneſs in the performance of what he hath ſaid, and therefore of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and more eſpecially upon thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes which concern Perſons in our particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar caſes, if it appear there are any, he hath any way by Revelation or Reaſon made known and ſignified to us. Here further we may call to mind the paſt Inſtances of God's Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Bounty to us, and principally thoſe
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:94938:35"/> which are the moſt like that which we now petition for. The Reaſon is, becauſe that which hath been done or come to paſs hath more of probability that it may and will be done again, than that which hath not. Wherefore this alſo will confirm our Faith, and conſequently encourage our Deſire or Prayer. Of this there are many Examples in the Scripture, eſpecially in the <hi>Pſalms.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But beſides this more proper and perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent uſe and effect of the expreſs Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment and Recital of the Divine Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Attributes in Prayer, and ſome few others mentioned, we may add here in ſhort only that it cauſeth us to admire the Divine Perfections, to honour and reverence God in the moſt real and ſerious manner, and in the higheſt degree we are capable of, to love him freely, chearfully, earneſtly, ardently, with all our ſouls, with all our might, all the ſtrength and vigour of our ſpirits; all which is extraordinary delightful, and only ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory to the ſoul of Man.</p>
                  <p>And if we leave out God, we can no where find comparably the like. God hath made us capable of the moſt intenſe and raviſhing Pleaſure in this enjoyment of himſelf, that is, in the employment of the operations of our Minds about him, than which, together with imitation of him, we know nothing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or greater.

                  <p>Further, This expreſs Acknowledgment of and Converſation conſequently of our minds with God ſpiritualizes our Minds, makes them by Uſe and Exerciſe more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of apprehending and being affected with all Spiritual things, as God himſelf and his Perfections, our own Souls, and what belongs to them, Virtue and Vice, Holineſs and Sin, the Rewards and Puniſhments of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Hell, the future States.</p>
                  <p>Again, This alſo enlarges and widens our Minds, makes us to be capable of and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and breath after the moſt excellent and perfect Objects; it makes us have an Opinion of the ſmalneſs and meanneſs of all other
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94938:36"/> things below God, and therefore of all things that are temporary and proper to this Life, to deſpiſe them comparatively, to aſpire and breath after the greateſt Perfection of Life and State we are capable of, things every way as near infinite as we can. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a ſoul that hath been able to be much or long thus employ'd, converſeth with world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things with a kind of condeſcenſion, and more out of neceſſity of this humane life, (chearfully notwithſtanding acquieſcing in it as the divine Will) than out of choice. But of this more particularly hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Again, It begets in us Humility, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains it, whilſt we cannot avoid ſometimes reflecting upon and comparing our ſelves with God, to whom, what a nothing are we when we are cloathed with our beſt qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and adorned with our moſt beautiful Plumes, for which we are ſo apt to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderately taken with, and to have too great an opinion of our ſelves. Whilſt alſo we take notice we have nothing from our ſelves, but are fain to be Beggars and Alms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>people for all we have. God the Almighty and All-good is the great Father and Houſhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of all the World, his Family; And nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we nor any thing elſe have the leaſt Crum of Bread but what is by his Proviſion and Appointment.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, To name no more, all this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:94938:37"/> of our Minds with God, diſpoſeth us certainly to an univerſal Imitation and Obedience, and conſequently to univerſal H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lineſs and Righteouſneſs, to all manner of Virtue and Goodneſs in the greateſt ſincerity, generoſity and conſtancy, (for ſo he is, and ſo he hath commanded) and conſequently to our own Perfection and Happineſs, by procuring of, and being inſtrumental to, according to our own Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Proportion, <hi>the greateſt good of the whole,</hi> the laſt end of all Being and Action.</p>
                  <p>And theſe are the Reaſons of this part of Prayer, of ſome of which again, and more in another general Head.</p>
                  <p>Of this firſt thing in Prayer, we have every where Examples in the Scriptures. In the Lord's Prayer our Addreſs is made to God by the name of <hi>Father,</hi> which is to put us in mind of the tender goodneſs of God in producing us, ſuſtaining us, providing for us conſtantly, educating and bringing us up, providing Portions for us hereafter. And the firſt Petition is, That his Name may be hallowed, that is, that we might have a due Opinion of, and a juſt, and therefore a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Honour for him, whereby he is ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from all other things. But eſpecially that which is called the Doxology, <hi>For thine is the Kingdom,</hi> &amp;c. is nothing but this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>n acknowledgment of God's Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:94938:37"/> and it is ſet down as a Reaſon of the preceding Petition, <hi>Deliver us from Evil, For thine is the Kingdom,</hi> &amp;c. that is, Thou indeed art King emphatically, thou haſt right and power to grant theſe things: And <hi>thine is the Power,</hi> Thou indeed art powerful, to thee eminently belongs Power; for in thee it is infinite, ſupream, uncontroulable, nay all Power is thine. <hi>Thine is the Glory,</hi> that is, All glorious things for which one is to be praiſed, extolled, honoured, glorified, (an ordinary <hi>Hebrew Metonymy</hi>) are in thee, and appertain to thee, and therefore we ought to pray unto thee.</p>
                  <p>So when the Apoſtles and Diſciples were to chooſe either <hi>Barſabas</hi> or <hi>Matthias</hi> by Lot into the place of <hi>Judas,</hi> they prayed and ſaid, <hi>Thou, Lord, which knoweſt the Hearts of all Men, ſhew whether of theſe two thou haſt cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen.</hi> To their Petition they premiſe an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of God's Omniſcience, very proper to that Petition: they deſired that God would chooſe, and that becauſe he knew certainly which was fitteſt to be choſen, <hi>Acts 1. Verſe</hi> 24. Another Inſtance of a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty long Prayer of the Diſciples we have, <hi>Acts 4. Verſe</hi> 24. When <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> were commanded by the Rulers, the Elders, Scribes and High Prieſt, that they ſhould not ſpeak nor preach in the Name of Jeſus, but threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them probably with Death or very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:94938:38"/> Puniſhment if they did; their Prayer or Petition was, That God would behold their Threatnings, and grant to them, that notwithſtanding they might with all boldneſs ſpeak God's Word; to which they premiſe God's infinite Power and Wiſdom in the creating of all things, and his Providence in foreſeeing them; that therefore he knew what was then done or deſigned, and was powerful to ſecure them from all their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious and ſevere threats, and to bear up their courage againſt them, yea and againſt the Execution of them too. <hi>Ver. 24. Lord, thou art God which haſt made Heaven and Earth, and the Sea, and all that in them is.</hi> In the Old Teſtament read <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s Prayer, when <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacherib,</hi> King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> ſent that blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and vaunting inſolent Letter to him; <hi>Let not thy God in whom thou truſteſt deceive thee, &amp;c.</hi> Kings 2. 19. 10. and <hi>Verſe 15. &amp;c.</hi> He prays, <hi>O Lord God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>who dwelleſt between the Cherubims, thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the Kingdoms of the Earth; Lord bow down thine ear and hear, open thine eyes and ſee, and hear the words of</hi> Sennacherib, <hi>which hath ſent him to reproach the living God,</hi> (in oppoſition to the dead Idols, whether the Images themſelves, or inanimate things, or dead perſons repreſented by them.) And <hi>Verſe 19. Now therefore, O Lord our God, I beſeech thee, ſave-thou us out of his hands, that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:94938:38"/> all the Kingdoms of the Earth may know that thou art the Lord God, even thou only.</hi> He premiſes the expreſs Acknowledgment of the Divine Supream and Uncontroulable Power to his Petition, both as an Honour to his God, and a cauſe of Confidence and Faith in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and conſequently of his petitioning God. And this eſpecially was moſt ſeaſonable, where there was ſome Power, <hi>(viz.)</hi> that of <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacherib</hi> and his falſe Gods oppoſed to the true God, and which indeed had prevailed againſt the reputed Gods of other Nations, which were in truth no Gods. And ſo it is always moſt proper where there is any thing that ſeems to flatten or weaken our deſire, there to take notice of ſome Attribute in God juſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, which may eaſily excite and embolden it.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>David's Pſalms</hi> nothing more frequent, and particularly in the 86. <hi>Pſalm:</hi> Read the whole <hi>Pſalm</hi> at leiſure, <hi>Verſe</hi> 5.

It will alſo well come in as a diſtinct Particular juſt after this, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately before our Petitions to render them ſtill more earneſt and ardent, becauſe we do not uſe to ask of any one, or at leaſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately, when we can probably or poſſibly have it done elſewhere, and leaſt of all if we can do it our ſelves.</p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:94938:39"/>
                  <p>Nay, here we may mention and reſlect upon the inſufficiency of all the Creatures in the World without God and independent upon him, to help us and do us good; and that what they can do is only by his power and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And that therefore there is a Neceſſity of God's Help, or we muſt be quite helpleſs; This neceſſity of having all from God, will ſtill make our Deſires more importunate particu'arly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him: But more of this hereafter.</p>
                  <p>II. The ſecond Action or Operation of Soul in a Prayer, is generally Confeſſion. For ſometimes this Part, as alſo others of Prayer, except Petition, may be omitted or uſed more ſparingly according as the Occaſion is. By which I mean (as in all parts of Prayer) not Words, or any other external Actions or Poſtures, but an expreſs Attention to, and Judgment that we are or have been guilty of ſome Sins or Faults directed and propoſed to God, which ſuppoſes a free and impartial Diſallowance, Diſapprobation and Diſlike, and conſequently a Determination and Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of Soul to quit and abandon them, and to do ſo no more. An expreſs and willing Judgment concerning our ſelves, that we are guilty of ſome things which are not reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and cannot be juſtified, is certainly, I ſay, a ſign of a preſent changed Mind and Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:94938:40"/> to be guilty no more; for what we have no mind to leave, and yet know it not juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable, we conceal it from others and our ſelves too, as much as we can, and will not attend to it, nor take notice of the unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs and iniquity of it, leſt we ſhould be engaged and pulled by contrary Appetites, (as that of good Opinion of others and of our ſelves concerning our ſelves, and that of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, Juſtice, Right, often ſigniſied by the name of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> (of which laſt there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in the worſt of Men) to leave that which we love better, and be diſturbed in the enjoyment of it, and conſequently poſſeſs it with leſs delight and ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>After this Change of mind, muſt needs alſo ſucceed a hatred and averſation from the ſin for the time to come, and a ſerious and ſincere ſorrow that we have been ſo fooliſh, unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, unhappy for the time paſt; on ſet purpoſe that we may be the more cautious, and flee more therefrom for the ſuture.</p>
                  <p>This Confeſſion is very proper in Prayer, for it doth ſtrengthen and embolden our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires thus: It is a ſign to us of a ſerious and real goodneſs in us, as I have juſt now ſaid; and what is ſo, confirms our Faith and Hope of God's particular goodneſs to us, and that we are more capable of his Favours: As be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſcious to our ſelves of the Badneſs and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:94938:40"/> Wickedneſs of our Temper, of too great kindneſs for any ſin, weakens and oppreſſes them. For we all naturally know God is righteous and good to the World, and that it is moſt for the good government of it, that he ſhould put good men into a good, and bad men into a bad condition; that it ſhould be well with the one, and ill with the other generally. But now what confirms our Faith and Hope, emboldens our deſire; what weakens and ſinks them, and makes it leſs probable we ſhould obtain any thing, though we ſhould deſire it never ſo importunately, cools and allays our deſire too.</p>
                  <p>And here the more comprehenſive and particular and accurate our Confeſſion is, ſo that we conceal not the leaſt Fault, but take notice even of ſmall ones; the more it is alſo principally of the greateſt and fouleſt, the moſt dear pleaſant and delightful ſins, the more it is of the aggravating circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of any ſin, that is, of thoſe things which are ſigns of a greater degree of ſinfulneſs in us, (ſuch as are, being againſt great means to be better, againſt much knowledge both of our duty and of the miſchievous conſequences of our ſins, againſt the divine bounty, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, or juſtice, or the like) I ſay the more our Confeſſion is thus performed, the more ſtill it is a ſign of a greater degree of ſincere and real goodneſs, and conſequently ſtill

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> condition. The ſame which that pious Soul <hi>David</hi> ſeems to affirm of himſelf, <hi>Pſal. 32. Verſe 3, 5. Whilſt I kept ſilence, my bones wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed old, through my roaring all the day long.</hi> Probably he particularly refers to his two great ſins, in which he lay for ſome time, concealing them and paſſing them over as
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:94938:41"/> well as he could, but his conſcience could not alwayes be quiet, he was ſometimes full of fear and ſhame, and ſadneſs and anxiety, and ſecret complaints. But then in the 5th <hi>Verſe,</hi> he acknowledged his ſin unto God, and his iniquity he did not hide, he conſeſſed his tranſgreſſions unto the Lord, and God forgave him. As the other cauſed great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet, this gave him eaſe. Beſides, it begets and maintains in us ſome branches of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; it gives us a juſt and true opinion of our ſelves, of our imperfections, as well as perfections; it makes us more ſee and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge our obligations to and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon God; it makes us leſs faſtuous and unreaſonably contemptuous of others compared with our ſelves; It makes us more to obſerve, and be ſenſible of the deſert of the great puniſhment due to ſin (God's good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs not conſidered;) and more earneſtly, to deſire and ſue for pardon and forgiveneſs from God, and more to reckon our ſelves obliged to him, and more to love him for it when granted; all which have further good effects ſtill.</p>
                  <p>The Examples of this in Scripture are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, ordinary and well known; as in <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah</hi>'s Prayer, (<hi>Nehem.</hi> 1.) for God's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance and favour in general to him and the <hi>Jews;</hi> and particularly, that he would give him favour with the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> that
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:94938:42"/> he might go and build <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth, that <hi>he and his Fathers had ſinned, had dealt corruptly and proudly againſt God, and had not kept his Commandments:</hi> A more large and particular confeſſion of the <hi>Levites,</hi> is in the 9th <hi>Chapt.</hi> of <hi>Nehem.</hi> In <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>Pſalm</hi> are every where Examples, eſpecially when he prays for the pardon of his ſins: in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51. he earneſtly importunes God for the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his two great ſins, <hi>Verſe</hi> 3, 4, 5. and then follows, <hi>I acknowledge my tranſgreſſions, and my ſin is ever before me.</hi> And more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, the corruption or depravation of his nature (it ſeems the moſt probable, as it is a true ſenſe) is confeſſed by him, <hi>Behold, I was ſhapen in Iniquity, and in ſin did my Mother con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me.</hi> And <hi>Pſalm 79. Verſe 5. O God thou knoweſt my fooliſhneſs, and my ſins are not hid from thee.</hi> He petitions God for help and deliverance, both before and after. And here, after confeſſion, it may be ſeaſonable to ask God pardon for the ſame faults we confeſſed, and conſequently that we may be the more capable of his favour in granting the other Petitions we ſhall make to him at the ſame time.</p>

                  <p>III. A Third Ingredient of Prayer, is Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of future Obedience. An expreſs devoting our ſelves to God's will, and conſequently to all inſtances of goodneſs and holineſs. An actual reſolution directed to God, that we will not be any more guilty of thoſe faults we confeſſed, nor any other to the utmoſt of our power. This, if it be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, is uſually accompanied with a very ſerious and earneſt intreaty, and beſeeching of God's grace and aſſiſtance for that end, and a dependency upon him, and truſt in him for it. Now this proceeds from the ſame ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual temper of mind that free confeſſion did, which ſometimes may be preceded alſo by ſome actual reſolution; but here it is more expreſs. Here is excited on purpoſe by the ſoul her ſelf, an actual inclination, will and reſolution, determination, bent purpoſe of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and univerſal obedience. The princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal reaſon of this is the ſame with the former, and in the ſame manner, it ſtrengthens and emboldens our Petitions and Deſires. For this expreſs and vigorous devoting our ſelves to obedience to God, is certainly an evident ſign to our ſelves of ſo much goodneſs in us, and conſequently that we are more capable of God's favour, and that it is more conſiſtent
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:94938:43"/> with his univerſal goodneſs, righteouſneſs or diſtributive juſtice to beſtow good things upon us, and particularly this which we now ask from him.</p>
                  <p>This further therefore excites in us an Opinion or Faith, and conſequently Truſt, that our Petitions may and will be granted, which, as I before ſaid, confirms and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens our Deſire. Whereas on the contrary, finding the Soul backward and detracting, loth and withdrawing it ſelf from this frank Obedience to God, as having ſome ſin it knows well, and is unwilling to leave, makes a Man very juſtly aſhamed and afraid to ask of God any thing. And here we ſhall do well to have a ſpecial care we do not coſen our ſelves by a raſh and heedleſs, or premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated Forgetfulneſs and Non-attendency, out of Self-flattery or Pride; and think and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt we do moſt univerſally quit our love to every ſin, and give up our ſelves to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Obedience; when, if we took time and carefully examined, we might find ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for the preſent, (it may be many Luſts) unmortified, which upon Occaſion would be too hard for our Obedience. Nor may it be amiſs to remember that there may be ſome luſt, which we might never have had the experience of, and conſequently which we cannot diſcover with ſtricteſt examination. Have we a care alſo that we do not miſtake
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:94938:43"/> in the Nature of Goodneſs, its Inſtances and Degrees: and confuſedly fancy and conceit our ſelves good, when we are not ſo, or much more ſo than we are; and that we being therefore without doubt very dear to God, he muſt needs hear us; a thing but too frequent. Wherefore much Care and much Modeſty well becomes us, and we ſhould refer our ſelves to God who perfectly knows the habitual Frame and Temper of our Minds after our own beſt Examination of our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>But beſides this Principal and moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Reaſon, there are alſo (as before) ſome others. As that this ſtrong and vigorous Act of our Souls confirms and ſtrengthens their habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Inclination to Goodneſs. This alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms in us and makes more ready at hand the Opinion of God's Univerſal Goodneſs and Juſtice, and engageth us to expect nothing from the Hand of God asked or unasked, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we be in ſome degree good. Examples of this are very frequent in the <hi>Pſalms. Pſalm 7. Verſe 1. David</hi> prays to God to ſave him from his Enemies, <hi>Save me from all them that perſecute me, and deliver me.</hi> And <hi>Ver. 6. Ariſe, O Lord, in thine Anger; lift up thy ſelf, becauſe of the rage of mine Enemies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>Verſ.</hi> 3, 4. he reflects upon his paſt Innocency, and particularly in ſomething his Enemies or his Conſcience might ſuggeſt whether he was not guilty, and upon the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:94938:44"/> greatneſs of his Goodneſs and Charity; that he had not only done good to his Friends, but even to his cauſleſs Enemies; [and ſurely he judged himſelf to be ſtill the ſame, and that he was not changed for the worſe] which without doubt gave him humble Boldneſs and Confidence of ſucceſs, and conſequently was the cauſe of the Earneſtneſs and Strength of his Deſire, that God would be pleaſed at that time to do that favour for him. <hi>O Lord, my God, if I have done this</hi> [that is, it may be, ſomething his Enemies might accuſe him of, or his Conſcience bid him to enquire into; or more particularly, if he had done that to them, which they did to him, (<hi>viz.</hi>) perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted them, and endeavoured and contrived to do them miſchief cauſleſly] <hi>If I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded evil to him that was at peace with me, (viz.)</hi> his Friends, or who had done him no hurt: <hi>Yea I have delivered him who without cauſe is mine Enemy: Then let the Enemy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute my Soul, yea let him tread my Life down in the Earth, and lay mine Honour in the Duſt.</hi> If <hi>David</hi> had been conſcious to himſelf of the like Injuſtice, or of any other Sin appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; that he had been, was, and would be ſo for the future; he would not have had the Confidence to have deſired this of God. And ſo in many places where he prays to God for ſome Favour, he profeſſeth himſelf God's ſervant; <hi>Pſalm 86. Verſe 4. Rejoyce the Soul
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:94938:44"/> of thy Servant. Verſe</hi> 11. He prays to God, <hi>to teach him his way, and he would walk in his Truth.</hi> That which was truly God's Way, and was truly right and to be done. And <hi>Verſe</hi> 12. he profeſſes he would praiſe God and glorifie his Name; which were Signs and Branches of his Goodneſs. And then <hi>Verſe</hi> 16. he prays, <hi>O turn unto thy Servant, and ſave the Son of thine Handmaid Pſal. 119. Verſe 94. I am thine, ſave me, for I have ſought thy Precepts.</hi> He had endeavoured and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to obey God, and he had given himſelf up to him (<hi>I am thine</hi>) (or God had eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially deſign'd him to ſerve him in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome) therefore he was bolder to pray God would ſave him, or deliver him from the Evils he was in danger of. And <hi>Pſalm 143. Verſe 12. Of thy Mercy cut off mine Enemies, and deſtroy all them that afflict my Soul</hi> (Suppoſe them ſo to continue as long as they had life, and were able, and not to repent) <hi>for I am thy Servant.</hi> And this is the beſt ſort of Vows, when a Man not only upon Condition that God will give him any certain thing he craves, expreſly wills and obligeth himſelf to do this or that particular good Work, or abſtain from this or that Fault or bad Action: but before-hand he gives up himſelf entirely to God, and vows and promiſes he will be his ſervant univerſally; and more particularly it may be too, where he thinks he may do
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:94938:45"/> the moſt good, or where he hath been the moſt faulty: And as for his Deſires and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, he refers them to the Divine Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and Wiſdom. He makes no bargain with God, only thoſe Duties which can only be done upon Condition of God's beſtowing his requeſted Favours, may be promiſed and profeſſed by him conditionally. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, to thank and praiſe God particularly for any Favour conferred; which cannot be, if it be never received.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="6" type="section">
                  <head>SECT. VI.</head>
                  <p>IV. A Fourth Ingredient in Prayer is Thankſgiving; that is, an actual loving of God for his Benefits al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready received. And this contributes to the ſtrengthning and invigorating of our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Deſires too. It is (as the reſt before) a neceſſary Sign, according to the degree of its vigour and frequency, of the ſame degree of Goodneſs in us. For if we love God for his Benefits, we ſhall naturally deſire to pleaſe him, and to ſeek to know what doth ſo: and that, we cannot be ignorant, is by doing his Will, or by keeping his Commands with Care, to be univerſally holy, good and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the grand Inſtance of univerſal Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, and conſequently Self-denial, and all the Branches thereof. I ſay according to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:94938:45"/> the degree of its Vigour and Frequency. For it's no wonder to ſee one who loves God for his Benefits, but ſeldom, now and then only, for one Fit, in a Prayer, never thinking of it afterwards; or in mean and low de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; one who loves God leſs and leſs often than many other Objects: I ſay, it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſee ſuch a Perſon to ſin and offend as often as theſe Objects are his Temptations: But if we loved God vigorouſly, and more than any other Objects, and ſo frequently that it became an habitual Temper of our Souls, it would moſt certainly produce in us the Effect of univerſal Holineſs. And ſo far forth as we find it in intenſneſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy in our ſelves, ſo far is it a ſign thereof, and gives us reaſon conſequently to think our ſelves acceptable to God, and that it may be the more reaſonable and juſt for him to beſtow the good things we ask.</p>
                  <p>I do not think that Love to God for his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits conferred upon ones ſelf, or Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is a principal Virtue, but an excellent inſtrumental one it is: It is not an Inſtance of formal Goodneſs or Virtue, but it is a very frequent means thereof, and therefore a ſign. But to love God for himſelf as a part, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther infinitely, the moſt conſiderable thing in the whole Univerſe, and therefore above all things, and with reference to the whole; this is indeed the nobleſt Inſtance of our Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:94938:46"/> The free and generous Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Reſentment of God our Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, of the Divine Favours already recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, is one good Uſe, Effect or Improvement of them, which hath a further one ſtill; (<hi>viz.</hi>) it cauſeth us to pleaſe God by keeping his Commands, and becoming univerſally holy and good, as I have before inſtanced; and being a very probable ſign of this, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> gives us a juſt Faith and Confidence, and heightens our Prayers and Deſires from God. Ingratitude, that is, a Neglect or Contempt of God's Favours already beſtowed, we may be ſure can give us no Encouragement; but it is a ſign of a dull, ſenſual, ſelfiſh; or wicked Mind, and ſo at leaſt of defect o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Goodneſs.</p>
                  <p>Again, actual Love to God for Favours received, impreſſeth upon our Minds the Memory of his paſt Goodneſs, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently gives us reaſon to argue he may be good to us again [ſuppoſing we ſee no Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances to alter the Caſe] in thoſe things we now ask: And the more ſtill, if the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours we have already received be of the ſame kind with thoſe we do now deſire. If it were before, it may be now [for ought we ſee] juſt and reaſonable for God to hear us. And this emboldens, animates and enlivens our Petition or Deſire ſtill more.</p>
                  <p>There are beſides theſe more proper, other
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:94938:46"/> collateral good Effects of Thankſgiving to God. It is a very pleaſant thing. For what more ſo than Love? what more delicious and ſweet? And what Friend is capable of being loved more than God? Where's ſuch a Friend and Benefactor as he from whom we have all? Again, the Reflection upon our own Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, upon our own Aſſurance of good things for the future, from the Experience of and Attention to the Divine Benignity and Goodneſs, is a very pleaſing and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory thing, that we are in the Hands of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Goodneſs; all which our Thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving gives occaſion for. And this we are moſt ſenſible of, when under any Frights or Fears of ſome great Evils juſt ready to fall upon us: then we greedily call to mind God's paſt Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>But here we muſt have a care of loving God <hi>ultimately and only</hi> for being particularly good to us, without at leaſt ſome habitual reference of it to the uſe of pleaſing him by doing the moſt Good we can; as a Man might love a good Maſter or any Perſon or Thing that is uſeful to himſelf, not much ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring whether he be ſo to any body elſe: all which indeed is no better than <hi>ſelfiſhneſs:</hi> But we muſt look upon God's Goodneſs to us as one particular Inſtance of that <hi>Univerſal Goodneſs</hi> to all for which we love him, and whereby we are engaged to love and pleaſe
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:94938:47"/> him, and conſequently to do good to all himſelf doth, and to be perfect and happy i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THe Sixth and laſt Ingredient in a<note place="margin">VI.</note> Prayer, is <hi>Petition,</hi> an expreſs De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that God would beſtow upon us ſome thing. This I make the very eſſence of Prayer, without which no Prayer. A Prayer may be without the reſt of the ingredients, but no Prayer could be without this; It would be called by another Name; they are all principally for the ſake of this, as I have in every Particular ſhew'd. They are but Helps to make this more fervent or more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive,

                  <p>Now there are two things generally here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to be conſidered and regarded, the <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And ſo in all the other parts of Prayer. In Acknowledgment are the divine Perſections acknowledged, and the Affections of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, Honour, Reverence, Fear, Love, Joy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In Confeſſion the ſins acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, and Grief, Sorrow, Hatred, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>pt of them and for them: In Profeſſion the ſenſe of what we profeſs, and the Paſſion and Diſpoſition of Devotion, Reſolution or obediential Inclination. In Thankſgiving, the Things thanked for and Love for them or Gratitude: Nay, in the R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ital and Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Caſes, the Senſe recited, and our Paſſion of Fear, Grief, Deſire. The Senſe or Things deſired, and the Paſſion of Deſire and its degrees, are variouſly expreſſed and ſignified in the ſame Sentence. The general thing expreſly or ſuppoſedly deſired, is, That God would grant us the thing we deſire (An account of the particular things to be deſired will be another general Head) by many words in the Scripture expreſſed both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and figurative; as <hi>give, grant, hearken,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:94938:52"/> ſee, behold, look down, regard, turn not away, hide not thy Face remember, forget us not,</hi> &amp;c. many more ſuch figurative expreſſions eſpecially may be met withal; becauſe when Men will and are inclin'd to grant any thing to a Petirioner, there are theſe bodily Motions or mental Actions which accompany it, or have ſome Relation to it: All which in God ſignifie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but to will the thing deſired, and to effect it; that he would command or will ſuch a thing to be done. The Paſſion of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire is ſometimes expreſſed in Sentences with Interrogations, or the like Schemes o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Speech.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Pſalms</hi> which are very Rhetorical (one part of which is to have Paſſions and great ones well expreſſed and ſignified) no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more frequent: As <hi>Pſalm 88. Verſe 14. Why caſteſt thou off my Soul? why hideſt tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> thy Face from me?</hi> That is, <hi>I earneſtly beſeech thee</hi> not to withhold thy Favour from me. <hi>And wilt thou be angry with us for ever? Wilt thou draw out thine Anger to all Generations?</hi> That is, <hi>we importunately deſire of thee</hi> that thou wouldſt be pleaſed to ceaſe to puniſh us. And ſo ſometimes Multitude of Words <hi>more</hi> ſignifie ſome degree of Paſſion than any different ſenſe. Nay very often the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of <hi>ſingle Words</hi> do not ſignifie <hi>any</hi> diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Senſes or Idea's, but <hi>only</hi> ſome degree of Paſſion. For the uſe of many words to expreſs
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:94938:52"/> one thing commonly proceeds from the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nds being longer detained in the thought of it by ſome paſſion. As when I call a thing <hi>noble, excellent, incomparable,</hi> all th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſe Words together generally expreſs or are a ſign of not ſo many different ſenſes; but only of a degree of Affection; nay very often ſome certain ſingle words or phraſes ſigniſie not the Idea's or Conceptions of things only: but withal a degree of ſome Affection or Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; as of Admiration, Love, Deſire, as in the words juſt now mentioned. So the word <hi>wretched Sinner</hi> to ſome Perſons ſignifies not only the ſenſe or conception of <hi>a mans being a great ſinner:</hi> but withal a greater degree of Hatred or Contempt or Indignation, than the word <hi>great Sinner.</hi> But of this more, and more particularly where we give ſome Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions concerning the Signs of our Senſe and Paſſions, ſuch as are Speech and Geſture.</p>
                  <p>From what hath been diſcourſed concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ingredients of a Prayer, we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that it thus perform'd contains all the parts of divine Worſhip. For there can be no other or more than to have God the Object of the Operations of our Souls, which is internal Worſhip, and to ſignifie this by ſome ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Where alſo it may be obſerved, that hardly any Man's Prayer but is more or leſs a Form, that is, it hath more or leſs of ſome Prayer which hath been before ſaid or recited by ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or other, at leaſt by himſelf, whether it
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:94938:56"/> was of his own or another's Invention. I ſay it is a Form more or leſs, and that not only in ſenſe, but in Words and in the Order too.</p>
                  <p>The greateſt Difference even in the Prayers of thoſe who are of moſt copious and various Conceit and Invention, is uſually in Words and Expreſſions, and Order of Things, which ſometimes may be one way, ſometimes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and yet the Coherence not very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, but very good by reaſon of diverſe Relations of things one to another. As one one and the ſame thing may come in, in a Prayer, after one thing as its Cauſe, and ſo as a Means; after another, as its Effect, and ſo as a Motive; after another as one of its Kinds or Inſtances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and if the Prayer be premeditated by a Perſon uſed to reaſoning, this Variety is more eaſie, but if it be <hi>extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore</hi> (ſuppoſing his Prayer be one continued thing without Interruption) his ſight of the Relation of things and his Reaſoning muſt be very quick, or elſe oft-times the Order and Coherence will be very impertinent, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable. Though the Truth is, that it is a thing of leſs Concernment, ſo the Matter be but true and profitable; and oft-times great and juſt paſſions cauſe a Man utterly to neglect Method. To affect Variety in Prayers as every where elſe, meerly for it ſelf, is a light and childiſh thing, and the being plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

                  <p>If the Prayer be <hi>diverſe</hi> from any other; it is either each time premeditated, or left to <hi>extempore</hi> Invention, Judgment and Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and that natural or inſpired. A Prayer <hi>diverſe</hi> from another might be otherwiſe from other Reſpects diſtinguiſhed: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe things are moſt talked of, and very uſeful things concerning them may indeed be obſerved, I ſhall take notice only of this Diſtinction, and further obſerve ſome things (not intending accurately to diſenſs the ſo ſiercely agitated a Controverſie which is beſt) concerning each of them.</p>
                  <p>Some therefore of the Advantages of Forms of Prayers of all ſorts in ſome degree or other, are,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, For the moſt part the Truth of what is prayed, as alſo a more extended great and conſtant Goodneſs of the Things according as they have been allowed, or not excepted againſt, and remain ſo: for there hath been more Time and more Perſons for the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and Examination of their Truth and Goodneſs, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n in premeditated or <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempore</hi> Prayers, and this ſtill the more they are Forms; that is, the more there are the ſame Things and Words in them, and the oftner they have been repeated, and eſpcci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally oy a greater Variety of Perſons. For more Perſons have had longer Time to attend to, to take notice, examine and conſider the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:94938:58"/> Truth and Juſtice of the things contained; and to remark what is unlawful, dubious, falſe, of little or of no good effect, or hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and miſchievous. And therefore it is moſt L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>kely they have <hi>actually</hi> examined or taken notice of them; and if they have done ſo, it is more likely they would have diſcovered ſuch things if they had been there. This, I ſay, is a very probable ſign of the Juſtice and Truth of the Things therein contained, and which is wanting in premeditated or <hi>extempore</hi> Prayers: I do not ſay it is a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one; for many things dubious, uncertain and not right, may eſcape the Notice or the Correction of many Ages. In a Prayer of; Man's own Compoſition, the oftner h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> hath uſed it, the more probable ſign it is hereof.</p>
                  <p>And here therefore publick Prayers have the advantage generally, ſo far as they are no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     </gap> them more Deſects and Faults, and ſome ſhameful enough. And ſometimes ſo many and ſo very bad, that their Prayers would be worſe than none, or but little better. The Things and Senſe being uncertain, falſe, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:94938:58"/> unlawful, ill expreſſed; of which more preſently. Nevertheleſs it is to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that as <hi>extempore,</hi> premeditated or private Forms of Prayer are more obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the Falſhood, Frivolouſneſs, Injuſtice, Diſorder of more of what is contained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and to many other Defects, than publick Forms: So publick Forms not only of Prayers but of all other things will have thoſe they have longer continued.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, ſometimes their Authority makes them leſs ſuſpected and examined; and then when any Defects are ſuſpected or known, they are not ſo readily declared out of Fear or a juſt Modeſty; and when they are declared, they are more prejudicedly and partially defended, and that generally by Perſons of the choiceſt Wit, and greateſt Ability; and when they are acknowledged by the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Society and of the Governors themſelves, it is diſſicult to have them alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, becauſe of the Number and Variety of Perſons both Governors and Governed, who are concerned to agree. And the Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience or ill Effects of Alteration is a greater Evil oft-times than the Continuance of many Defects. For it is firſt difficult to get all the concerned Perſons together; and amongſt ſo many Perſons many things are objected and debated, which takes up Time and Pains, eſpecially if ſome being (as there always are)
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:94938:59"/> paſſionate and prejudiced, do not only calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly propoſe, but contend and contrive that their Opinion may be retained or received. Sometimes it is difficult to cauſe a new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution to be known, or practiſed by the governed; and many other inconveniencies may there be. We ſee by experience, how hard a thing it is to have any Defect, though plain enough, altered in publick Opinions and Practices conſtituted. Wherefore the Conſtituters of publick Forms of Prayer, and ſo of Opinions and other things, have the more need of being wiſer and uprighter than the Authors of private ones, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is not always ſo: But ſometimes they may be compoſed and conſtituted in an ignorant, hypocritical, prophane, cunningly Tyrannical, or Senſual age. There are many Prayers conſtituted or allowed of by that no leſs boaſting than corrupt Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which in reſpect of their Falſhood or Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, their Trivialneſs and Uſeleſsneſs, their Impertinency, Diſorder and Confuſion, a Man of ordinary Examination and Underſtanding would diſdain to uſe himſelf, or appoint for the uſe of the meaneſt and moſt ignorant. And I think I could inſtance in ſome as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible as any fanatical Mechanick among us hath blundered out <hi>extempore.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Another advantage of a Form of Prayer conſequent upon the firſt, is, that a Man
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:94938:59"/> may more joyn in his affections with all that is prayed, and eſpecially if it be a Form to him, that is, he hath often heard it repeated. For he being more reaſonably ſatisfied, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Teſtimony, partly poſſibly by his own Examination of the Truth and Righteouſneſs of the things in the Prayer, hath nothing to do but to ſend up the Deſires of his Soul, or to raiſe up other ſutable Paſſions and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in himſelf; whereas a Man being more reaſonably obliged to examine other Prayers, and to know both theſe before he be affected with them, his Time will be taken up there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and little or none left for Affections. Nay, he may be ſo long in attending to the Truth or Juſtice of one thing ſpoken, that he may neglect the greateſt part of the reſt. Beſides that Examination and Attention to and Judgment concerning the Truth of Things, naturally indiſpoſeth for all Paſſions, but moſt eſpecially juſt at the time thereof. The reaſon why this Diſadvantage of preme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated or <hi>extempore</hi> Prayers of ſingle Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons hath not by moſt of the Deſpiſers of Forms been taken notice of, is becauſe they have taken all for true and good which Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have ſaid, and never examined, or they have formerly and perhaps often heard the ſame things from them and others in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and ſo far theſe very premeditated or <hi>extempore</hi> Prayers are indeed a Form to theſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>earers.</p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:94938:60"/>
                  <p>3. Another Advantage of Forms where the ſame Words are uſed is, That in them the Senſe is better conveyed, the Meaning of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions is better underſtood. Men, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the vulgar, by often hearing and attending to Words and Expreſſions, uſually know better what they mean, than thoſe which are new and not before heard.</p>
                  <p>4. Another Advantage of Forms is, that they are very uſeful for the Memory: being often repeated, they are more impreſſed upon the Memory, and ſo if they contain any good uſeful thing, are always the more ready for Uſe, come oftner to the Mind, and thereby do ſome general good. They can alſo be better quoted and cited by one to another upon Occaſion of Advice or Reproof; when one asks another whether he be, and adviſes that he would, or minds him that he is not ſo good as his Prayers. Beſides, it hath ſome more Authority; it is a Prayer which he himſelf hath liked, approved, joyned in; it is readier therefore for uſe; a Man needs not ſtand firſt to prove the Truth or Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Thing, but preſently apply it: Whereas in Prayers which are always di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, there is little by moſt remembred of them, and if they be forgotten, they can do no more good then what they did at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent when ſpoken: nor if they be remembred, can they be ſo preſently made uſe of, nor have
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:94938:60"/> they ſo much Authority, as Forms. On the other hand, the Advantages of a premeditated Prayer may be,</p>
                  <p>Friſt, Increaſe of Knowledge, there being uſually more Variety of Things, and Things more particular and diſtinct. This is an Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of premeditated or <hi>extempore Prayers,</hi> not of <hi>a Prayer:</hi> Of <hi>many</hi> diverſe Prayers op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to a Form not of <hi>one only,</hi> for one Form may contain as much variety of things, as one premeditated or <hi>extempore</hi> Prayer: but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diverſe premeditated or <hi>extempore</hi> Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers oppoſed to the ſame Form as many times repeated give Occaſion for a more various and diſtinct and particular Knowledge of of Things. It puts Men upon Invention and Conſideration of things, it prevents I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>leneſs, and conſequently which moſt-what follows Ignorance, Dulneſs and Senſuality; it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Men more to imploy their Minds about the two moſt excellent Objects of them, Truth and Goodneſs. It ſeemeth therefore in this Reſpect of one very good Conſequence generally (for there is Exception) that the Clergy be at leaſt permitted to compoſe Prayers of their own as well as Sermons: but then it would be of better Effect ſtill if they had at leaſt ſometimes one or more Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors to be their Auditors to overlook them, and prudently to incourage them when they
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:94938:61"/> did well, and direct them when they might do better. There may be both too little and too much Employment: they both are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally Cauſes of doing very ſlightly and ill what is done.</p>
                  <p>(2.) Conſequently for Attention to what is contained in a Prayer, premeditated Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are a help thereto. For what we very well know, what we have often heard, we are apt to neglect: What is new whether Senſe or Expreſſion, we are apt to take more heed to, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o mark and obſerve; and this becauſe of all our natural Appetites to increaſe our Knowledge and the Perfection thereof. It is reaſonable we ſhould gratiſie this Appetite; but then we muſt have a care that we do not preſer it before a better: that is, that of the Profitableneſs or Excellency of the Objects of our Knowledge. We muſt not prefer the Novelty or Variety before the Utility of our Knowledge, and ſo it may be Triſles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore very uſeful Things: We ſhould order it ſo too, what we can, as to make them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent one with another, and one ſubſervient to the other. As that the Variety be of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable and excellent things. But very often Variety and Utility of Conceit are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally inconſiſtent, and the firſt is often a ſign and ſometimes a cauſe of the want of the ſecond.</p>

                  <p>Men of very various conceit are often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in Judgment, or rather in the percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion and ſight of the Truth and Uſefulneſs of things, of which the cauſe might eaſily be more particularly ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore we ſhould be ſo far from a general Approbation and Admiration of Men meerly for Variety and Multitude of Conceit, that it ſhould rather (if we ſee no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to the contrary) diſpoſe us to undervalue them, as being a probable ſign of the Defect of a far better Quality than that is.</p>
                  <p>(3.) Another Advantage of premeditated Prayer, is the ſeaſonableneſs and pertinency of things in Prayer. For there may happen ſome Wants which could not be foreſeen at any diſtance, and therefore not provided for; or if they he, yet ſome may be more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly and diſtinctly, and with more Variety of Phraſe or Speech, and other ſigns both of our ſenſe or meaning and of our affections (which may be of good uſe though always the ſame perſons ſhould be our Auditors, much more when there are many of different capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities) inſiſted upon at ſome Times and Places than at others.</p>
                  <p>The Goodneſs of ſuch things too thus ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, pertinent and preſent, is more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apprchended, and conſequently prayed for with more ſtrong and vigorous Affections.

This reality and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency of affection is truly a very great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, ſuppoſing the affections to be rightly and in due degree directed to things true and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: but if that be not ſuppoſed, it may be as great a miſchief. For great inordinate and immoderate affections miſerably corrupt the judgments and inclinations; they render them erroneous and ſuperſtitious: and I think one of the principal cauſes why of late diverſe premeditated, nay <hi>extempore</hi> Prayers have been preferred before Forms, whether publick or private is an immoderate love to great and buſling affections for any thing though never ſo unworthy of them, to which we may add great variety, and quickneſs of conceit and invention, as in <hi>extempore</hi> Prayers.</p>
                  <p>The Advantage of <hi>Variety</hi> and <hi>Copiouſneſs</hi> of Conceit is both in premeditated and <hi>extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore</hi> Prayers: and is becauſe there are <hi>many</hi> of them uſed in Oppoſition to but <hi>one</hi> as often a repeated Form, as is before ſaid.

A Fault that is very often committed in Sermons and Books, and other Performances, by thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who obſerve and complain of it in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. If we ſeparate things and compare them; without doubt it is better that one and the ſame excellent good thing ſhould be

The firſt indeed doth leſs good, but yet ſome; but this laſt doth a great deal of hurt. If we muſt loſe or part with one of theſe, it is better to loſe that of Variety and Celerity and Copiouſneſs of Conceit, and ſtrength of Paſſion, than that of the Certainty and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitableneſs of the Objects of our Knowledge and Wills. It is better to have no Paſſions at all, and conſequently in this ſtate generally but languid and weak Inclinations, than to have them directed to wrong Objects, or to right ones in an exceſſive degree.

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:94938:64"/> were generally of an active and paſſionate temper, but thoſe who were for ſome Forms at leaſt were of a more ſtaid and compoſed one.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe Prayers in which are Variety, Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and great Affections, do more generally pleaſe Men, and are preferr'd before thoſe in which there is Truth and Uſefulneſs, for two reaſons among others.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe Men are amiſs and depraved in their Inclinations, and love thoſe qualities better than theſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Becauſe thoſe of variety, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and affectionateneſs are diſcerned more eaſily by every body in a Prayer; thoſe other of the Truth or Uſefulneſs not without more difficulty and but by very few; it is a difficult thing to examine and ſee them. The beſt is to make uſe of them all as there may be juſt reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Be we ſure that the Objects of our Knowledge and Wills be true and good, and then let us furniſh our ſelves with as plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a knowledge of them, and have as ſtrong Affections to them, in compare with other things, as they deſerve.</p>

                  <p>It is certainly one of the moſt general and miſchievous Cheats in the World, that Men Judge things good or bad, and more or leſs ſo according to their inclinations, which are principally cauſed by paſſions: (Though not always) and not according to the ſight of good or bad Effects, which is the principal uſe of our Reaſon. We ought therefore, if we be not ſo diſpoſed, to ſtir up the greateſt Affections and maintain them in our ſelves
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:94938:65"/> Affections and maintain them in our ſelves, for thoſe things which really are the greateſt good things; which are ſo the moſt Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally, the moſt Intenſly, and moſt Conſtantly. Such as are generally in Forms, and in the publick moſt likely, if compoſed and allowed by Judicious, wiſe, generouſly Religious and Pious Perſons.</p>
                  <p>The things which do moſt affect Men (we may obſerve) are ſelfiſh, ſenſible and preſent good things; ſometimes one, or t'other; or all theſe; ſuch as are our being in God's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, our being elected, juſtified, pardoned, ſaved, when others are reprobated, condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, puniſhed Eternally, ſometimes Riches, Plenty, Health, good Relations or Friends, Honour or the like; all which oft-times are the leaſt good things, and leaſt to be deſired compared with others: either becauſe they are but ſenſible or preſent or ſelfiſh good, or all of them. Whereas things of more univerſal and publick good Effect, Spiritual, future, ought more to be deſired, though commonly they are much leſſe. Such as to be perfectly inherently righteous and holy, to love God for himſelf, and pleaſe him, to be univerſally diſpoſed and enabled to be beneficent, or Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Charity and Beneficence, ſelf-denyal, Reſignation to God's will, becauſe always for the Univerſal good, Humility, Spirituality of mind, Mortification of all our Luſts or inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate

We are more to deſire the moſt publick and Univerſal good, than our own, and therefore our perſection more than our Happineſs, the Love of God and Charity more than our own Felicity; Again, Spiritual good things more than ſenſible; future more than preſent. Our Judgment finally of the Truth, and of the degrees of the utility and Excellency of the things ſhould direct our deſires and all our Affections in our Prayers. Which Judgment [as I ſaid) we are to informe as well as we can by our own Wiſdom and Reaſon, by God's Word, and by the Teſtimony and Examples of wiſe holy and good Men (ſo far as we ſhall have reaſon impartially to think them ſo; and we muſt uſe the beſt means we can to know who are ſo) and laſtly much by a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Senſe &amp; conſequent Paſſions; God having made our minds ſo as to be much affected with ſome things, our Conſciences allowing it: he hath anticipated our Natures with ſuch Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, if we can diſtinguiſh them from others contracted by bodily temper, educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Example. This of Teſtimony and Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of thoſe whom we judge wiſe and good Men, is ſo conſiderable amongſt Men, and hath naturally ſo much Influence, that few Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are determined in their Opinions by any other reaſon: and I think it one of the reaſons
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:94938:66"/> why a premeditated Prayer; and even a Form compoſed by a private Perſon and reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by himſelf, hath been generally prefer'd before a Form compoſed by the Publick, and recited by a private Perſon: <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe Men generally are moved to think and judg the things true or profitable, which are ſaid or recited, by the Teſtimony and Example of him that ſays and recites the Prayer: If he judg that it is ſo, they are apt to judg ſo too, and conſequently to be affected.</p>
                  <p>Now Men judge that he that recites a Prayer compoſed by himſelf, did and doth judge the things true and of great Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſees them to be ſo; otherwiſe why ſhould he ſay thoſe things rather than others: But they, as they think, have not the ſame reaſon to judge ſo of him, who is obliged to recite a Prayer compoſed by another. For he is obliged to ſay and recite that and no other, and therefore he doth it; when it may be he attends not to, nor is affected with the Truth and Goodneſs of the Things he recites, any more then a School-Boy is with his Leſſon. Nay, though the Reciter of ſuch a Prayer ſhould have as many exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſigns of Reverence and Affection<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> as he that recites a Prayer of his own Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet his Example and Teſtimony is not ordinarily ſo efficacious. For Men are apt
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:94938:67"/> to think that that Affection may come from Cuſtome or Compliance, or the like.</p>
                  <p>But here we ſhould do well to do theſe three things:</p>
                  <p>Firſt. To look upon ſuch publick Forms as compoſed by the Publick, who moſt-what are to be preſumed wiſer than private Perſons, and that they did judge the things true, and of exceeding great Profit and Benefit, or elſe they might have choſe other things as well as thoſe, let the Reciter behave himſelf as he will.</p>
                  <p>And then Secondly, That ſome and ſurely conſiderable Men, who recite them with Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, do it <hi>really</hi> in thoſe things which they judge, and becauſe they do judge them true and exceeding profitable, not only out of Cuſtome and Compliance: And then it may as reaſonably be ſuſpected that the great Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of thoſe who recite their own Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers oftimes (eſpecially in extempore) are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, leaſt they ſhould ſeem could, oft-times they proceed more from their being their own, and invented by themſelves, (as we ſee Men are very apt to be much pleaſed with their own) than out of any clear ſight or Judgment of their Truth and Utility. If they do judge they are true and profitable, that very Judgment
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:94938:67"/> may proceed from that Self-Love and Eſteem.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly. We are therefore to excite and ſtir up our Affections, (which otherwiſe) it may be are dull and ſluggiſh in Proportion to ſuch our Judgment, though we ſhould not have the Example of him that ſays or recites them. If we think not good to follow the Judgment of the Publick herein, we ſhould have great and clear Reaſon againſt it, and ſuch Modeſty as to be backward to ſignifie it.</p>
                  <p>Let all Men here, as in all Prayers, do what they can; what they ſee and aſſent to as true and Judg it good, and ſo far forth as they do ſo, let them joyn in that, and ſtir up and excite their hearty affections in that as much as they can; not through Lazineſs or Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice eſpecially from Revenge, wilfully neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ect or reject it. We have ſaid, That the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of ſincere and fervent affections in diverſity of Prayers is more uſual or <hi>general,</hi> but not <hi>conſtant</hi> or <hi>Univerſal.</hi> For ſometimes on the contrary a form of Prayer may be more affectionately uſed. As when perſons are of a ſlow and ſtaid temper, not caring to enlarge their knowledge or their deſire, but very well content with what they have: alſo when they believing what they already have
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:94938:68"/> in their Prayers to be very excellent or the very beſt, or much better then what they are likely to meet withal in any other, purpoſely keep &amp; cheriſh their affections for thoſe things upon which they have already placed them, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them from others. For then by reaſon of frequent &amp; repeated Conjunction, their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are far more real, ready and ſtrong to thoſe things which are contained in their Forms; then to any new things not before heard by them in other Prayers. As admiration and eſteem of any thing are cauſed by ignorance of what is better or equal to it (as it is in new things where we have not time nor perhaps ability to compare) ſo are they much more by a knowledg or belief that nothing or very few things are ſo. Such a knowledg and judgment is much more the cauſe of eſteem and love then ignorance.</p>
                  <p>If wee'l try for Example in the Lord's Prayer we may find it ſo. If we often ſay, <hi>Our Father,</hi> and have a clear apprehenſion of the comprehenſive ſignification of the Word, (viz.) that God is wiſely and tenderly good to us, hath brought us forth, brought us up, doth ſtill and muſt always provide for our good in all reſpects Spiritual, bodily, here, hereafter; and as often endeavour to joyn a cordial and ardent Affection of Love to this our dear Father, and joy in him: we ſhall find that by frequent uſage when we pronounce
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:94938:68"/> theſe words. We ſhall moſt readily have ſuch a conceit and Apprehenſion, and ſtrongeſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections too at the ſame time. And ſo when we pray, <hi>Forgive us our Treſpaſſes,</hi> &amp;c. Have we then an Apprehenſion or ſenſe of the moſt intenſe and moſt Univerſal Charity (for whom ſhall we not love, when we love our Enemies) and conjoyn we ſtrongeſt and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſt deſire therewith, ſend the Petition wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped up in an inward ſigh that God would grant it us; we ſhall find upon uſe that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we hear or pronounce the one, we ſhall be the moſt apt and ready to have the other too. Thoſe who have piouſly and devoutly read the holy Scriptures may have oft-times experienced, that if any ſentence therein hath much affected them, the oftner they have thought thereof, the more real and ready and great hath been their Affection. There may be too much Frequency and the Succeſſion may be too quick: What Invervals of Forms are convenient and do not hinder Attention and Affection, will eaſily be known by Experience: where let us be aſſured there be no Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>extempore</hi> Prayer left to the <hi>extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore</hi> Memory Invention, Judgment of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citer whether natural or pretended to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired, it hath ſo much the diſadvantage (to compare it firſt) of the other two, <hi>viz.</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like or private Forms, and premeditated Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:94938:69"/> and the Inconveniencies thereof are ſo many more and greater, and the Convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies ſo much fewer or leſſe, that it is never to be admitted where they can be had, except very rarely. As where a Perſon may be of ſuch a peculiar Temper that his <hi>extempore</hi> may be better then his own premeditated or recited Form, and in it ſelf too very good. Some Men may have more conſiderable things ſuggeſted by a quick and ſudden Excitation and heating of themſelves with exerciſe and by conſequent bodily Paſſions, and they may give better Judgment of their Truth and Uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: than if they conſidered never ſo long, with which their Heads are dulled, Attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on confounding them. Nay even according to the conſtant Laws of Union between body and Soul, or <hi>naturally,</hi> they may hereby be more generouſly, intellectually, divinely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and inclined, (viz.) to things that are large and great, and therefore to things that are future, Spiritual, of moſt Univerſal good Effect, their animal Spirits being in great Plenty ſubtilized, and ſtrontly but not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governably agitated. Where we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that governable bodily Paſſions are not to be always neglected, but they may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times on purpoſe made uſe of and approved by our Prudence.</p>
                  <p>But except I ſay ſuch a rare Caſe; only where a Form or premeditated Prayer can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:94938:69"/> be had, an <hi>extempore</hi> one may ſometimes be uſed.</p>
                  <p>As where a Perſon hath not the other two preſent, or hath not Leiſure and Time to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditated one; and yet it is expedient that ſome Prayer be recited to, as in ſome ſudden Danger.</p>
                  <p>Even in profitable Affections, much more in Senſe and Words, the other Prayers have the Advantage of <hi>extempore</hi> Prayer. For that Affection which is in it, is moſt-what forced and ſtrained, or excited by loud Voice and bodily Action, or by bodily Temper in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and is not the Effect of any preceding Judgment of the Goodneſs and Truth of the Things prayed, even in thoſe very Perſons themſelves who pray, as inconſiderable as their Judgment may be, though moſt Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors are oft miſtaken and think it is. Or their Affections are but the reliques of ſome they have formerly had, it may be, with Judgment little enough. Whence they are generally leſs and more ſuperficial than eſpecially in premeditated Prayers, where we have with Approbation pitched upon things; it is ſure they are worſe uſed and placed.</p>
                  <p>To ſpeak of it abſolutely, ſuppoſing a Man could uſe no other: ſometimes it may be worſe than none at all, ſometimes better than none, ſometimes very good. It is according

St. <hi>Paul</hi>

Thoſe three Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinth,</hi> (viz.) 12, 13, and 14. would do well to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten read by thoſe who are apt to pretend too huffingly to, and value themſelves too much by the Gifts of the Spirit.

                  <p>If it pleaſed God to afford a greater degree of this Aſſiſtance to do good this way, there is no good Man I ſuppoſe but would be very glad thereof, and willingly receive it, and thank God for it: And for ought I know it may be afforded to the World in greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, Firſt, in reſpect of good and holy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations and ſenſe of Soul called <hi>Graces,</hi> and then in thoſe Perfections of our underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which are called <hi>Gifts,</hi> before the whole deſign of Chriſtianity, and conſequently the preſent condition of Man-kind here on Earth

They ſee it the general Opinion and Practice of all Men. This doth maintain a general Senſe of God in the World, and oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times doth much good, and the World would be much worſe (as bad as it is) if it were not for thoſe publick Acknowledgments and Worſhip in Prayer and other Offices performed to him.

                  <p>Long and fierce hath been the Contention and Strife amongſt us concerning this <hi>external Worſhip,</hi> but too certain a Sign and Cauſe of the Decay and Neglect of the <hi>internal Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> before mentioned. For thoſe whoſe Minds are ſeriouſly and really taken up with ſo noble and high an Employment as the Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Admiration of God's infinite Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, a ſincere and ardent Love, obediential Reſolutions, Truſt, Joy, Acquieſcence in God, are very little ſolicitous concerning any the external Signs thereof, or ſeldom take any Notice of them but when and ſo far as they obſerve them to be any Hindrances or Helps in themſelves or others to the internal things ſignified, which oft-times is very little and uncertain. Nevertheleſs no Men have more and more proper natural Signs of inward Worſhip or Devotion than they; no Mens Carriages and Demeanors more ſhew it than theirs. And as it is a Sign (I ſpeak of fierce <hi>Contention about,</hi> not the <hi>Uſe</hi> of external Signs) ſo it is a Cauſe of the Neglect of the internal Worſhip of God.

Moreover this habituates Mens Minds to little and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible things, and makes them inept for thoſe truly great and ſpiritual, unfit to apprehend and be affected with them: Whence they are filled with Superſtition, that is, a great Zeal and Eſteem for and conſequently an Opinio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Controverſie is not whether there ought to be any external Signs, and other not
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:94938:79"/> neceſſary or changeable Circumſtances in publick Divine Worſhip: (for all among all Sects acknowledge and practice it, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but do ſo) but whether there ought to be any inſtituted and commanded by any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church which are not commanded in Scripture by Chriſt or his Apoſtles. The Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative of which Queſtion is undoubtedly true. And it is ſomewhat the more ſtrange it ſhould be doubted or denyed by any Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Chriſtians (if ſome may be ſo called) when they themſelves find it plainly neceſſary to practice accordingly. For I do not think there is any one of the wildeſt of them who do not by conſent and agreement, (contrary to which they will not permit any one of their Society to act) uſe external Signs of inward Worſhip and other not abſolutely neceſſary Circumſtances which never were command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or uſed by Chriſt or his Apoſtles. Which uſage and practice, though it have not ſome Circumſtances of a Law or Command: yet it hath the Power and Force thereof, and as much reſtrains Liberty. For Example, Some of thoſe Perſons who are of that Perſwaſion, and therefore ſay a Church hath not Power to command him who Officiates in the Church to wear a white Garment: yet they will not permit him to wear any other than a black as a ſign of Gravity (though<note place="margin">Linſchot. Itineran.</note> it is ſaid in <hi>Japan</hi> they uſe white
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:94938:80"/> for a ſign of Mourning, and therefore I ſhould think of Gravity too &amp; black for a ſign of joy) or at leaſt any other light or gaudy colour: they will not permit him the Garb of a Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man or a Souldier; none of which things are particularly any where forbidden or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded againſt by Chriſt or his Apoſtles: Nay it is more likely that in their Preaching they uſed the Habits of Men of their Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or Quality in their Country. So moſt of thoſe Perſons (for ſome I have heard af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the contrary) who will not for the ſame reaſon permit any Church to enjoyn kneeling at the Lord's Supper: yet they themſelves will not permit any Man to take it in our Table or Meal Poſture and therefore with his Hat on, which is not commanded againſt by Chriſt or his Apoſtles: Nay it is moſt likely it is contrary to the Example of Chriſt with his Diſciples. For it is not much to be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but that they took it in the Manner they uſed to diſcumb to eat, (<hi>viz.</hi>) with their Heads covered according to the then Cuſtom of that Age and Country. The like may be ſaid of the Time, (<hi>viz.</hi>) Evening, and of many other Uſages.</p>
                  <p>The Jewiſh Church had always this Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Priviledg, of inſtituting and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things in the external Worſhip of God, ſo they were not contrary to any thing that God had commanded; and accordingly it was
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:94938:80"/> made uſe of in abundance of Inſtances, as hath been moſt evidently proved by ſome late learned Men: To which many more might be added, if this were a Place to diſcourſe the thing ſo largely. The whole Synagogical Worſhip is one comprehenſive Inſtance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, or elſe the Records we have of <hi>Moſes's</hi> Law and the ſucceeding Ages of the <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>wes</hi> Affairs are very deficient. There are many parts thereof which have poſitive Teſtimony of their Inſtitution by the Governours of the Jewiſh Church; as the reading of their <hi>Haph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taroth</hi> or their Sections of the Proph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I ſhall only moreover very briefly mention ſome few general things concerning theſe Conſtitutions in external publick Worſhip with all due Deference and Submiſſion.</p>

I know this is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of vaſt and unlimited Extent, but I am well aſſured that there is no other abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely univerſal Rule of all our Actions. And there are but two Ways to know what is ſo, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Teſtimony divine and humane, and Reaſon. Or but one, <hi>(viz.)</hi> our Reaſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Teſtimony and Prudence: that is, by others or our own perception and ſight of things. If God hath univerſally by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Revelation to others or our ſelves commanded or forbidden us any Action, we may be ſure that always to do or abſtain from it hath moſt Conveniencies, and is the beſt, though poſſibly to our Prudence there may appear ſometimes the contrary. But if there be nothing in Revelation, our own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon muſt comprehend as well as it can all good and bad Effects or Conſequences of any Action or Omiſſion of any Action, making all juſt and prudent Uſe herein of humane Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and direct us to chuſe that which hath the moſt good and the feweſt evil ones. There is no Action whatſoever, except the Will of the laſt End, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Univerſal good,</hi> in which alone formal Virtue and Rectitude is to be found, which hath not both. And therefore we are not preſently to throw away a Conſtitution or Law becauſe we obſerve ſome one or more Inconveniencies in it to
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:94938:82"/> ſome Perſons at one Time, nor to receive it becauſe we take notice of ſome few Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies: but we are to comprehend all of both as far as we can, as to Perſons, Degree and Time, and accordingly determine.</p>
                  <p>But Secondly, One very general Sign or Inſtance (yet poſſibly not without its Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as ſometimes in caſe of many good mens very zealous and ſierce oppoſition through ignorance, or bad mens through perverſneſs, and of complyance with other Churches) that a conſtitution in the external Worſhip of God is of more good Effect than if it were omitted, or than another in its Place, is it's Tendency the moſt in thoſe preſent Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances to beget and increaſe both in us that uſe it, and in others that ſee it, the internal Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God: <hi>(viz.)</hi> the moſt perfect or beſt Knowledge, Apprehenſions and Opinions concerning God, his Nature, Will and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the greateſt Admiration, Honour and Reverence, Love, Gratitude, Deſire, Truſt, Joy, Obedience and Imitation of God, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the moſt perfect inward Holineſs, Righteouſneſs, Virtue of Soul in all particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Branches and Inſtances: in four Words, the moſt ſincere, univerſal, vigorous, and conſtant Holineſs. And this is that which is or ſhould be principally meant by their being for <hi>Edification.</hi> And as for the preciſe notion
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:94938:83"/> of <hi>decent</hi> or <hi>decorous,</hi> It is nothing but a Thing's being a Sign of ſome uſeful or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable Quality in us; as contrariwiſe an indecent thing is that which is a Sign of ſome imperfection within us either natural or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, as imprudence, rudeneſs, irreligion: but more ordinarily of that which is natural, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> that which is rather only contemptible than hateful. And it is principally in order to edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by good Example.</p>
                  <p>Some of the moſt conſiderable Ways or Means how we may come to know what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Signs or any other Circumſtances do moſt tend to this Effect of Edification, are;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, A moſt ſincere and generous Love <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

I ſay, the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mediately and the ſhorteſt way: For it ſeem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> to have been a frequent miſtake or non-at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance in ſome who have really deſired and intended the promotion of this internal Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God which may be called <hi>Piety;</hi> tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> they have applied themſelves to thoſe mean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> which are ſo indeed but in ſmall degree and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:94938:83"/> very remote, and therefore uncertain, and take up a great deal of time and pains which might have been elſewhere better employed for the ſame purpoſe. They require ſo much time and conſtancy to drive them through a long train of ſucceſſive cauſes to their end, that men ſeldom have the patience or liſt to purſue them ſo far, but ſit down and reſt themſelves and are well pleaſed with the means themſelves, forgetting or neglecting the end of them. We are not to take pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently and make uſe of every real means which may effect our propoſed end: but only thoſe which will the moſt ſpeedily and fully do it, and even of thoſe, the ſeweſt we poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly can. It is alſo certainly one of the beſt Ways to obtain an End by any certain Means, to have it perpetually and only in our Mind and Intention when we are uſing that Means. Like as it is a moſt probable Means to hit the Mark to have it ſteadily in our Eye, or to come to a certain Place to have it as frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in our Thoughts as needs, whither we are going. And in truth the neglect of this ſeems to be one of the moſt frequent Cauſes why in many particular Churches, as the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they have ſo many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions and Rites either perfectly uſeleſs to this great End of the inward Worſhip of God, and univerſal Holineſs of Soul; or ſo little and remotely ſubſervient thereto that
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:94938:84"/> either they have ſeldom attained it, or it is not worth the trouble of the Governor and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned to conſtitute and obſerve them; or finally they are contrary thereto, and more Obſtructions and Hindrances thereof. Other meaner and more puerile or vulgar Ends and Deſigns, as Beauty, Ornament and Pomp; or ſometimes wicked and ſelfiſh ones, as Honour, Power and Wealth have interpoſed and quite intercepted the End above mentioned. Not but that I think they all of them may honeſtly and prudently be adhibited in ſome degree in order to that End: but we are to ſcorn that ſuch mean things ſhould terminate our View, and be the ultimate end of our Conſtitutions.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, A ſecond means to know what external Worſhip conſtituted tends to the promoting of the internal Worſhip of God is the moſt exact Knowledge of humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we can get: to know what external Signs or other Circumſtances of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Actions or Operations of our Minds do moſt naturally cauſe them in us: which are exceeding various according to the Variety of Tempers, Uſages and Conſtitutions of ſingle Perſons or whole Nations, ſome there are which may be general and well near uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal. And here we muſt uſe principally our own Reaſon, Experience and Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:94938:84"/> both in our ſelves and others. We may alſo make uſe of others Obſervation and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and conſequently their Uſages and Conſtitutions, as it follows in the next Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. For what may be further obſerved in this, I refer the Reader to what he will find in the latter end of this Treatiſe, <hi>(viz.)</hi> concerning the due Qualifications of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Signs both of Senſe and Operations of Soul in Prayer.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, A third Means is all Teſtimony both divine and humane, whether we have it from expreſs Words and Injunctions as in Scripture Commands or Canons of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or from Examples and Practice. Which Teſtimony is ſo much more valuable as the Perſons are more ſincere in the End be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, and more prudent and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcreet to know and obſerve the Means which will beſt attain it. Moreover it is carefully to be obſerved whether their Teſtimony be concerning the ſame thing to be conſtituted, <hi>i. e.</hi> the ſame or rather the like in all Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which may alter the caſe. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that the Circumſtances be not ſo diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, as that that external Worſhip which was then and there for Edification or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting of the internal Worſhip of God, or univerſally of more good Conſequence than bad, be not ſo now amongſt thoſe who are
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:94938:85"/> to make uſe of their Teſtimony. Particular reſpect muſt be had to the Extent of the Conſtitution, whether it were to all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of all Places and Times, or directed only to a particular Church and for a certain time. And here in the firſt place comes in divine Teſtimony, any Conſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>utions to all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans made by God himſelf, which are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly to be perpetually obſerved as tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the true end thereof before mentioned. Theſe, if there be any beſides the general one of Decency and Order, are to be ſought for in the New Teſtament. Next may be taken notice of all the particulars of the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Worſhip of the <hi>Jews</hi> appointed by God himſelf alſo in the Old Teſtament: where all Circumſtances are to be conſidered before they are imitated, and whether there were not ſome peculiar ones which made them ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary then, or very ſubſervient to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Worſhip of God or other good Effects, the which now being wanting may render them uſeleſs or of more bad than good Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. It is certain, moſt of their Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in their external Worſhip were of this kind; as all their Sacrifices, their diſtinction of Meats, their legal Uncleanneſſes, their Feſtivals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is as certain that ſome of them were ſuch as may be well imitated by moſt Chriſtian Churches now, in order to the aforeſaid Ends. As a ſetled Maintenance for

A great many of them have been by way of imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion introduced into very ancient Chriſtian Churches ſome ſooner ſome later, as much of the Situation, Diviſion, Form of our Churches and Church-yards in Imitation of their Temple; The Habits of thoſe who offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate in Religious Aſſemblies, Caps, Hoods, Surplices, Caſſocks, Girdles ſeem to have been in Imitation of the Prieſts Bonnet (<gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:94938:87"/> doth now by Experience appear (and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it will ever be otherwiſe in larger Churches, eſpecially God knows, when in Liberty and Peace) that a very great number of Perſons are not yet ſo inwardly Religious as to abſtain from many indecent things, and ſome which are Signs of ſottiſh Irreligion, contemptuous Prophaneneſs and Pride; or to follow the Advices and Intreaties and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of their Superiours, eſpecially Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical though of acknowledged Prudence and Piety. Nay I think at this time in this Nation Perſons are generally diſpoſed rather to do clean contrary even in things manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough of good uſe, and which it would become Prudence, Piety and Charity to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point. Which Humour ſeems ſtill to be of the growing ſide, and is juſt the contrary Extreme to the receiving all Inſtitutions, though manifeſtly hurtful or uſeleſs, with Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. Which one conſideration may afford a ſufficient reaſon for ſome diverſity of external circumſtances in the Celebration of the Lords Supper even from the practice of our Lord himſelf and his Apoſtles. <hi>Jeſus</hi> himſelf is not now preſent to diſtribute it.

Nor ſeems it leſs adviſable, that the few things which are conſtituted be of great and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt good uſe, and particularly for Edification, that ſo thoſe who enjoyn, teach or uſe them, may the more eaſily juſtifie them and not ſpend too much time in diſpute about them, and thoſe who are enjoyned them, being without ſcruple, may the more chearfully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them.

For if any be admitted for the reaſon of ſome ſmall though real con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:94938:88"/> it will make way for all thoſe (and they are none knows how many) which can alledge as much.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It is undoubtedly beſt that the Perſons who conſtitute and appoint ſhould be not the <hi>People,</hi> who are generally ſo ignorant and ſelfiſh: but the <hi>Governors</hi> of each Church, who are generally more wiſe and generous, of more publick Spirits. The larger the Church alſo the better, for by that means the Conſtitutions are of greater Authority, and more freely obſerved; generally alſo they are both wiſer and fewer, as being made by a greater Number of wiſer and honeſter Perſons, and thoſe of different Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Tempers, and then as being to fit a greater Number of Perſons. The ſame may be ſaid of Articles of Belief.</p>
                  <p>The Conditions of Communion both in Doctrine and Diſcipline are likely in equal Time to be far more numerous and of leſs conſequence in leſſer Churches, ſuch as ſome amongſt us affect and contend for, than in larger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſuch as Dioceſan, Provincial, Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and if it were poſſible, one Univerſal Church; and conſequently there will be leſs of Liberty in them.

A Man may uſe it thus: (<hi>viz.</hi>) though he himſelf ſhould be guiltleſs, yet he may acknowledge that thoſe are Sins, and are to be acknowledged and confeſſed by thoſe that are guilty whoſoever they be in the Congregation. The like is to be done in Thankſgiving, and in ſinging of <hi>Pſalms</hi> which uſually contain theſe and other parts of a Prayer before mentioned. The <hi>Pſalms</hi> alſo are always to be recited as a hiſtory of the thoughts and affections and condition of ſome holy and devout perſon though one ſhould not have or be in the like himſelf.</p>

And ſo a Prayer, at leaſt many of the Ingredients in it, may be either for ones ſelf, or for other Perſons, whether the Prayer be Publick, Private or Secret. Thus our Petitions and Thankſgivings and Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments may be for the whole Creation, for all the Inhabitants of this Earth all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; we may petition and thank God <hi>for his Goodneſs to us and to all Men,</hi> to the Church or Chriſtian Society, to the Nation of which we are Members, to the Pariſh or Place of our Habitation, to the Family in which we live,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:94938:90"/> to any Society to which we any way belong to, our ſelves, or any other part or parcel of God's Creation capable of receiving any thing from God, and acknowledging him for it according as their Wants and Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are. And the greater the Number of theſe is on whoſe behalf we pray or give thanks, the more comprehenſive and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, the more fervent and enlarged ſhould we be therein. And ſo it ſhould be in our Prayers for thoſe upon whoſe good the good of others much depends, and whoſe good is a more comprehenſive and diffuſed good, ſuch as Governours of all ſorts Civil and Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical, and any Perſons who have Riches, Power, Wiſdom, and Knowledge, or any ability to do good, that they may have an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable Goodneſs.

                  <p>There are in General but two Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our Petitions or the things we ask.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, That we want them. If the things be not juſt we ought not to ask them, and if we have them already we need not, though the continuance of them we may.</p>
                  <p>Now the things which it may be moſt juſt for God to give, and which we may at ſome time or other want, may be ſuch as theſe.
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:94938:91"/> The principal thing to be asked and the greateſt good that we can ask, or God give, is our greateſt Perfection, (<hi>viz.</hi>) Holineſs, Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs, ſincere Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs, a good honeſt Mind and Heart, Virtue, Grace, as it is uſually called. All which ſignifie the ſame general thing with ſome ſmall Differences, (<hi>viz.</hi>) a Will habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually inclin'd to a Man's Duty, to what is right, what his ſincere Conſcience or Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Right or Wrong directs him to, and commands him. We are to ask and beg of God moſt earneſtly as the greateſt Boon he can give, that he would beget or ingenerate in us Grace in ſome conſiderable degree, (for all Men have, it is likely, ſome faint and little one already; the worſt of Men hath hardly quite extinguiſhed this Tendency or Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite after Righteouſneſs) that he would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and augment make it more vigorous and ſtrong in us, and at leaſt to be ſo ſtrong, as to be prevalent over all our other Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites and Inclinations, That we may habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally more deſire, will and love Holineſs than Riches, Honours, all ſenſual Pleaſures and Delights, finally, than all things the Heart of Man can deſire beſides: Nay, that we may love it in ſuch manner and its great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance <hi>Univerſal Love</hi> with its Object <hi>the greateſt good of the whole Univerſe,</hi> as to love it only, and in all other things; or all other

That our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections inordinate and immoderate may ceaſe ſo to be, and be turned <hi>ultimately</hi> to and in the higheſt degree placed upon Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and the things ſo often mentioned, to which we were before but too dead and cold; that is, that we may be converted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed.

(Rom. 13. Verſe</hi> 12.) That as Chriſt's or as Chriſtians we may <hi>crucifie the Fleſh with the Affections and Luſts. (Gal. 5. Verſe</hi> 24.) In this and ſuch like manner we may conceive, expreſs and ſignifie our hearty unfeigned eager Deſires, that God would make us in general holy, righteous, good, conſcientious, honeſt, virtuous, regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, converted, renewed, penitent, and keep us ſo, and make us more and more ſo to our Lives end.</p>
                  <p>But this in general may moſt often not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: but we may proceed further to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Inſtance or Subject of Righteouſneſs, (<hi>viz.</hi>) Univerſal Charity or Benevolence to all the Univerſe, God and all his Creation; and then to particular Virtues, which are but ſo many Inſtances or Inſtruments of Univerſal Charity.</p>
                  <p>As Love to God for himſelf, as a Being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely perfect, and moſt capable of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and therefore rejoycing that his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection

Further, to love him without any reference to our ſelves, ſeparately, but as a Being infinitely good and benign, and uſing all his other Perfections of Power and Knowledge to do good with to all his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of which we have a ſhare, even all that we have that's good, being the Effect thereof; nay all evil things (abſolutely in themſelves conſidered) to any particular Creature are permitted and diſpoſed by him for the good of his whole Creation, and therefore all things that are come from his Goodneſs. And this is that very Perfection of Righteouſneſs and Holineſs and its only Inſtance Univerſal Love and Benevolence in God, which we before were to deſire for our ſelves; and when we pray to God that we may love him, if we have but a tolerable diſtinct conceit of him, it is principally that we may love Righteouſneſs and Holineſs, Univerſal Beneficence and Love it ſelf. For theſe are the principal Attributes of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; <hi>God is Love, and he that dwelleth in Love</hi> therefore <hi>dwelleth in God.</hi> Pray we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to God that he would work in us a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere ſtrong habitual Love to himſelf, that we might love him <hi>with all our Hearts and Minds, and Might and Strength and Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. (Matt. 22. Verſe</hi> 37.) And that he would <hi>direct our Hearts into the love of himſelf. 2 Theſſ. 3. Verſe</hi> 5.</p>

                  <p>Next to this may follow Charity: which more preciſely ſignifies Love and Good Will to all Creatures. To do which to each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular with the limitation of its <hi>deſert; i. e.</hi> ſo as is moſt conſiſtent with our Univerſal Love to all, and as far as we ſee effective of the greateſt good of the whole, is the true notion of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> or giving to every one his due.

                  <p>After theſe may follow the things, which for the moſt part are uſeful and ſubſervient while we are in this Life (and ſome of them proper thereto) to make and keep us good or make us better, or any way enable us to do more good, to execute our Goodneſs more immediately or remotely. Such as are long Life, eſpecially till we come to be good, to be converted, to repent; that we may have the Experience of our own Sincerity and Strength in Goodneſs, be profitable to the World by our good Example, as we have been but too miſchievous and hurtful, it may be, by our bad one, have the Joy and Comfort of this both in Life and Death, as alſo from a reaſonable and juſt confidence and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of God's Love and Favour both here and hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Again, Health, Freedom from Sickneſs, Diſeaſes, Diſtempers, eſpecially thoſe which may indiſpoſe and diſable us from being wiſe and good (as many do) and which may incline us to what is weak, imperfect, bad, either immediately, or by the Uſe of Means for their removal.</p>
                  <p>Further, Peace, a State of good-will of all
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:94938:97"/> Men towards us and towards one another, a good Government, good Laws, good Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, good Neighbours, Power and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy our ſelves, according to our Integrity and Ability to uſe it as well or better than others, which ſometimes our but allowable Modeſty and juſt Opinion of our ſelves, and eſpecially our well diſpoſedneſs to uſe it well, for the good of others, may permit us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and oblige us not to refuſe. Add hereto Liberty, Honour, Good-Name or Reputation, to be beloved, Friends, Relations, Riches, and all the Conveniencies of Diet Cloathing, Habitation, Servants, Aſſiſtants, Attendants, Freedom from hurtful Care and Solicitude and Temptation about worldly things, juſt and ſober Recreations, which theſe Riches can and do uſe to procure. Theſe general things and many more numberleſs particulars may be the Matter and Contents of our Prayer to God that he would give and grant them us, and moſt what in this order; but let us be ſure that all be for the Ends and with thoſe Conſiderations expreſſed or preſumed that I have mentioned.</p>
                  <p>Behold then here a ſhort Scheme of the general Heads of moſt, at leaſt of thoſe things which we may have need of either at all times or ſome time or other; and which therefore may be the Matter of our Petitions and Deſires, when we pray or addreſs our
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:94938:98"/> ſelves to God either ordinarily or extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily.</p>
                  <p>And here it may be obſerved firſt, That all theſe things ſome or other of them may be put into our Petitions, for any other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons when we pray for them. For Example, We ought to pray for all the Univerſe, that God would make it perfect and happy, we may and ought particularly to pray as hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily for other Men as for our ſelves, that God would ſo diſpoſe the Affairs of Mankind as to make Men more <hi>ſincerely, generouſly,</hi> and <hi>conſtantly</hi> holy and good; That Men may more love and obey God their own and all the World's Maker and Benefactour, and imitate him more in the Univerſal Love of all, and right uſe of any Power or Ability they have derived from him. That Men may be more wiſe to underſtand and know the greateſt good they can do for themſelves and others, and the Ways how, and all things whatever which may enable them or help them thereto; That Men may more univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally obtain all the Perfection and Happineſs their Nature is capable of, be more knowing, wiſe, prudent, holy, good, and in all inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces virtuous; and in order hereto, that more Men may be Chriſtians, and Men which are ſo may be more ſo; That they may better underſtand the Doctrine and Contents of the Chriſtian Religion and their reſpective Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:94938:98"/> and Uſefulneſs, and attend to and be affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted accordingly therewith, and therefore principally with its ultimate end and deſign, which is to make men holy and happy. That they may be free from Ignorance, Error, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition (a moſt miſchievous ſort thereof) Formality, Hypocriſie, Pride, Tyranny, Affectation of Equality and Superiority, Contention, Strife, finally from all <hi>ultimate ſelfiſhneſs.</hi> That Chriſtians might be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from being deluded or drawn or driven by fooliſh, ignorant, erroneous, proud, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical, envious, vain-glorious, conceited, and ſelf-ſeeking men. Many good things there are alſo which may be proper to others, to their Conditions, or Circumſtances; as to all ſorts of Governours and Governed (that the one may rule well, and the other obey) to Magiſtrates and Subjects, Parents and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Husbands and Wives, Maſters and Servants. So alſo for whole Communities or Societies, ſome good things may be deſired which are proper to them, as Unity.</p>
                  <p>It is to be obſerved farther, That the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our Prayer or Petition may ſometimes be all or more fore-named particulars briefly mentioned only, and ſometimes, and that moſt commonly, but ſome of them enlarged.

                  <p>It is not ſurely unlawful for one that is more and much more generally bad than good, and therefore may be termed a wicked or bad man, to have good deſires, to pray to God to give him his grace to repent and be better (which he may be ſo well-diſpoſed at at ſome particular time as to do) and then his pardon for Chriſt's ſake, to pray for relief in his diſtreſs, deliverance from evils, compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency of the good things of this World, God's bleſſing upon his endeavours, and all this that he may ſerve God comfortably, and do good: to pray for his Family or Children out of ſenſe of his duty and natural affection: to beſtow his bleſſing out of good nature, compaſſion, charity, gratitude upon the afflicted, his friends, his benefactors. Surely, I ſay, this is not unlawful, nay it is his duty: though at the time he doth thus he may in general be a bad man (yet in theſe his Prayers good) and ſo far it ſhould be probable that at leaſt ſome of theſe Petitions ſhould be rejected or not granted.</p>

                  <p>THe Fourth general Head of our Diſcourſe concerning Prayer, is the excellent ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, the advantages or benefits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. I mean of <hi>praying</hi> or <hi>a Prayer,</hi> not only of that one part of it called Petition. Theſe all are to be ſo many reaſons why we ought, and ſo many Motives to us to pray: for from the good effects of any action, are all the reaſons and motives for its performance to be taken.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Benefits may be of two general ſorts, <hi>viz.</hi> (1.) To others, (2.) To our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>1. By our Prayers we may do good to others. For it may oft-times ſeem reaſonable and juſt to God to beſtow upon others what we ask and deſire as we ought for them, upon the condition of our Prayers: ſo that if we had not prayed, God might not have given it. For this his hearing our Prayers for others may as reaſonably be an Inſtance of God's Goodneſs and Benevolence to us as any other good thing, and it may be as great an Engagement to us to love and thank God;
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:94938:101"/> and as a Reward it may engage us more to acknowledge and depend upon himſelf (which are ſuch excellent Means of making us good) and to proceed to love others, and to rejoyce in others good. Beſides, if we be generally very good Men, this inſtance of God's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to us in hearing our Prayers for others, will very much engage and encourage others to an Imitation of us, and to be good like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that they may have the ſame Favour and Honour from God too. For a great Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour ſure it is, and a great ſign of our being acceptable to him, when he is pleaſed to grant our Petitions, not only for our ſelves, but for others likewiſe, for whom, out of Love, Charity and Compaſſion we heartily pray.</p>
                  <p>It is true, God beſtows upon us the great Favour of granting our Petitions, or hearing our Prayers for our ſelves, for Jeſus Chriſt's ſake: but it is upon the Condition of <hi>our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing holy and good.</hi> Upon this <hi>ſame Condition,</hi> for Jeſus Chriſt's ſake, he may and doth do us that particular Favour of hearing our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for others likewiſe; that he may ſhew and declare how acceptable to him Holineſs and Goodneſs is. And it was our Saviour's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſpotleſs and perfect Holineſs, that meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from God the Pardon of all our Sins, in caſe of Repentance, for his ſake, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently all his Favours, and particularly the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:94938:101"/> hearing of all our Prayers both for our ſelves and others. By which we may eaſily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand how God may hear our Prayers for one another, and that for Chriſt's ſake.</p>
                  <p>We have ſtore of Examples and Commands in Scripture for all Men, eſpecially good Men, to pray for others: we have alſo there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes that they ſhall be heard, and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances too, that is, the ſucceſs recorded.</p>
                  <p>God commandeth <hi>Job</hi>'s Friends to go to <hi>Job</hi> to pray for them, with their burnt Offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, that God would forgive their raſh and unadviſed Speech concerning himſelf, out of Envy, Contempt or ill-Will againſt <hi>Job,</hi> it is likely: and tells them, that he would accept his Servant <hi>Job.</hi> Here God even forgives ſome ſins of ſome few Friends, or rather omits <hi>ſome</hi> Puniſhment for them, upon Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Job</hi>'s Prayer, and for his ſake; <hi>Job 42. Verſe</hi> 7, 8, 9.</p>
                  <p>A great part of the Puniſhment of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for their ſottiſh Idolatry in worſhipping the <hi>golden Calf</hi> ſo ſoon after their coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſeems to have been forgiven upon <hi>Moſes</hi> his Interceſſion and Prayer. For it is ſaid, that God threatned to conſume them, and to make of <hi>Moſes</hi> a great Nation: but upon <hi>Moſes</hi>'s beſeeching the Lord, that he repented him of the Evil that he thought to do unto his People. I ſay, God forgave a great part of their Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:94938:102"/> not all: he did not utterly deſtory <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

They often pray to God to make them good, to amend them, and even while they are bad to forbear them, and not to puniſh them, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by laying evil things, or taking away good things from them, whilſt bad Men out of a malicious or revengeful Spirit, wiſh and rejoyce in the miſchief of good Men their greateſt Benefactors and of one another.</p>
                  <p>Finally, Good Men (ſo far as ſuch) always wiſh and pray in general for good things to all Men, even their Enemies and bad Men, and to every particular perſon all particular good things, until they ſee it is inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with a greater good in the World ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where elſe.</p>

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:94938:103"/> Man is far from making the Satisfaction he hath in his Goodneſs and his conſequent Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with God, his only or laſt End<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but principally at the ſame time he regards too his pleaſing God and good done to others, for which God is pleaſed to make him an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument.</p>
                  <p>And here let us be ſure we are good and ſincerely holy Men, if we will have this Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge with God and Favour from him; not only preſume and fancy our ſelves to be ſo, and vindicate our ſelves for ſuch, meerly for ſome things which may be done by really bad Men and ſecret Hypocrites. Then we are ſuch and ſo far forth as we do things out of a ſincere Conſcience, that is, out of a ſincere <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Deſire</hi> to do the thing that is <hi>right,</hi> and therefore with a cautious and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Deſire of knowing the Truth concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what is right, our Duty or what we ought to do; and when the Principles of our Conſciences, or that with which they are informed, or that which influenceth our Judgments concerning our Duty (for they may be corrupted) are a ſincere Love to God that we might pleaſe him, and a univerſal Charity, ſuch as I have juſt now mentioned; when we deſire to know our Duty that we may pleaſe God, and more certainly be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to do more good. We are far from this temper of ſincere Holineſs when we are
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:94938:104"/> puffed up, conceited and hugely pleaſed <hi>ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately</hi> with our ſelves, that we are the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſo highly in the Favour of God, and have ſo great a Priviledge and Power with him, as to call down Bleſſings preſently, not only for our ſelves, but for others, and Curſes too perhaps, if we pleaſe. A good Man is not thus affected at all, but deſpiſes and hates any ſuch Temper of Mind when he finds himſelf tempted to it.</p>
                  <p>Further, If we modeſtly take notice at any time, that God hath been pleaſed to grant us ſuch a Priviledge becauſe truly good, we are to be adviſed to call to Mind, who it is that hath made us ſo: To attribute and aſcribe humbly all the Goodneſs we have, and the Favour of honouring and rewarding it ſo, to his own free though eternal and immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Goodneſs and Benignity of Nature: That we and all we can do, and do do, are me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately or immediately from him, and depend upon him as the Cauſe: that without him we neither are nor can do any thing. For whatſoever Ability, Strength, Liberty we can truly pretend to, it is from<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> him, and dependent upon him, and could never have been nor now be without him. Thus ought we modeſtly and truly to think of our ſelves (and ſo far as we do not it is from Pride, and we are bad Men.) And conſequently to be accordingly affected with Contempt, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervaluing
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:94938:104"/> of our ſelves utterly in compare with God in this reſpect, when God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſo highly to favour us, and to grant us ſo noble a Priviledge as to make us holy and good, and then to be as it were the effectual and ſucceſsful Mediators and Procurers of Bleſſings and good things for others: not to arrogate and aſſume falſly to our ſelves the being in the leaſt the <hi>ultimate</hi> or <hi>principal</hi> Cauſe thereof, with a Forgetfulneſs and Neglect of God, and conſequently without all reaſon, ſtrutting and being puſſed up and big with our ſelves; being pleaſed <hi>ultimately</hi> in the Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſuch a Power and Priviledge, as if it were really from our ſelves; in which, if we were humbly and not proudly diſpoſed, we ſhould not be ſo careleſly ignorant or miſtaken. Nay, let me ſay, if it were poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (as it is not) to have any ſuch Priviledge or Power from any thing in our ſelves inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent upon God (as ſuppoſe the good uſe of our liberty,) yet if we pleaſed our ſelves only in the Poſſeſſion, Uſe or Effect of it to our ſelves, and not in the good and benefit of others procured thereby; we are ſo far forth not good Men. And therefore whatever we may fancy our ſelves, we are not the Perſons, unleſs we be ſomewhere better, whoſe Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are ſo acceptable and ſucceſsful with God, nor have we ſo much Power with him.

                  <p>(1) Prayers do confirm and increaſe our Goodnoſs. They tend much to preſerve us
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:94938:106"/> therein, and to make us better, and that theſe ſeveral ways amongſt others.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, By the actual Exerciſe and Uſe of it, or of the immediate Means thereof.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, By ſuggeſtion or bringing to mind our Duty, or what helps to practiſe it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, By being an Occaſion of Imitation of God.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, By putting us in mind particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of the Condition of our receiving all other good things beſides Goodneſs, nay of our receiving a further degree of Goodneſs it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, By way of Remuneration or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. All which I ſhall a little more expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate.</p>
                  <p>(1) By being an Occaſion of the actual Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe and Uſe of Goodneſs, or of thoſe things which immediately are the moſt frequent and effectual Means thereof. And this is eaſily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by running over all the Parts of a Prayer we have formerly mentioned: As,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The Confeſſion of our Sins, that is, an expreſs Judgment concerning our ſelves directed to God, that we have been guilty formerly, or are ſtill of ſuch and ſuch ſins, and a hearty Diſapprobation, Diſlike, Diſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowance
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:94938:107"/> thereof, a Contempt or Hatred of them, and of our ſelves too ſo far as we have been guilty, a hearty ſorrow that we have ever been ſo imperfect, wicked or unhappy, and a chearful, free and firm Reſolution to do ſo no more, but to be good, and to do our Duty, to do what we have been faulty in omitting, and to abſtain from and abandon what we have been guilty of in doing; to mortifie and extinguiſh all the <hi>Inordinacy</hi> and <hi>Immoderacy</hi> of any or all our Appetites, that is, all our Luſts or the Corruption of our Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitos, and to excite and quicken our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and Love to our Duty, and to Obedience to God, whoſe Commands are the Rule of it.</p>
                  <p>Now Confeſſion of our Sins thus expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, and in this ſenſe is an actual Exerciſe or Exertion of the Habit of Goodneſs and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or of Grace in us, as it is uſually called; ſo often as we thus pray we ſtir up and excite and put forth into Action our habitual incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Goodneſs and Holineſs: But every Action and Exerciſe confirms the Habit to which it belongs, ſtrengthens and increaſeth it. All Habits may be thus gotten, and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever gotten (though immediately by God's Influence, which is called Infuſion) yet they are thus maintained, ſtrengthened and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed. The moſt ordinary Perſon may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this by Experience. The more of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:94938:107"/> we actually hate or are grieved for or at any thing or Perſon, the more we are incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſo to do; inſomuch that at laſt we may not endure the very ſight or mentioning of them. And ſo it is in Love: what things we have accuſtomed our ſelves and uſed often to love, we contract a moſt ready, firm and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Inclination ſo to do; inſomuch that ſometimes we cannot be for any time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them. In the very like manner it is when we actually often abominate Sin in general, or any one in particular, when we hate, contemn, are grieved for it; when we hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily love our Duty, and with the whole ſtrength of our Souls deſire and will we may be univerſally or in any particular innocent or good: we ſhall at laſt arrive to that habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Temper of Love of Goodneſs and our Duty, and hatred of Sin, which will be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, ſtrong, vigorous and conſtant, and ſhall not endure the Sight or Suſpition of any Sin in our ſelves, nor be able to live com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably without the conſtant conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to our ſelves of as great a degree Innocency and Virtue as we can by any Means attain to.</p>
                  <p>Profeſſion of our future Obedience (which was another Ingredient in Prayer) as I have explicated Confeſſion, is included in it, and is nothing but an expreſs Action or Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Will excited by the Soul, and directed
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:94938:108"/> to God to be obedient to him in general or in any particular where ſhe hath been faulty; and that now by his Aſſiſtance and Strength which ſhe humbly implores, ſhe will obſerve to do her Duty, the Rules of which are his Will made known by Reaſon or Revelation. Which expreſs Action of hers, or actual Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution (and the more frequent the better) muſt needs preſerve and increaſe her habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Temper or Inclination. Prayer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thus performed by a rightly informed diſcrect and knowing Soul according to its Fervency and Frequency hath a moſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Influence to preſerve and ſtrengthen us, to make us grow in all Goodneſs; And the neglect of it may reaſonably very often (not always, becauſe there are other Means) be the Cauſe of Perſons declining and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more cold and indifferent in all their Duty.</p>
                  <p>I do not ſay that all Prayer is a neceſſary Means of Mens growth in Goodneſs; not are we preſently to expect ſuch mighty diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between all thoſe who pray and thoſe who do not. And then upon any diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by the miſcarriages of ſome who uſe it, gladly take occaſion to reproach or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the Duty, as a uſeleſs but troubleſome thing, as ſome naughty men are apt to do. For men may perform it very erroneouſly, idly and careleſly. And then they may ſo
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:94938:108"/> engage their Affections with that Concern and Conſtancy to other Objects in the World after they have done their Prayer, that they may quite forget it, or drown and overcome the good Senſe and Affections they had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Whence their Prayers are but little effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual.</p>
                  <p>From all theſe Cauſes it often comes to paſs that you may ſee thoſe that are not negligent in this Duty or Performance, but frequent and conſtant and long too, ſo bad in their Tempers, Lives and Actions all the Day, that you can ſee little Difference between them and thoſe who do not pray at all. Little I ſay, for I am apt to think there is ſome general good, uſually by the meaneſt performance of it, and Men who are bad would otherwiſe <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally</hi> be much worſe; and therefore though Men ſeem to be very little the better for their Prayers, I would not have them to leave them quite off for all that.</p>
                  <p>As for Acknowledgment of God's excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Perfections, his infinite Power, Wiſdom, Univerſal Goodneſs, his Bounty, Mercy, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is another Ingredient in a Prayer. It is manifeſt, That the oftner we do this the more Spiritual our Minds are; and we ſee that by Exerciſe and Uſe we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend and conceive theſe ſpiritual things more ſtrongly and clearly, and our Affections too of Honour, Admiration, Reverence,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:94938:109"/> Fair, Faith, Hope, Joy in God, and Love to him grow more ſubſtantial and real, more ſtrong and vigorous, not ſo faint and languid; ſo that we feel them in our Breaſts as really and as powerfully as to any other Object; we come to have a real Underſtanding, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, Senſe and Affection for thoſe things when they are named; we know and feel them in our Minds and Hearts; we know what it is, and have it as really in our ſelves to honour, fear and love God for his infinite Perfections, though inviſible as a Prince at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with all his Enſigns of Majeſty and Greatneſs, and whom we know to be as wiſe and good as great.</p>
                  <p>By our frequent Converſe thus of our Minds with God, he becomes readily a very real thing to us, is really perceived by us, and hath real Influence upon our Affections: whereas before we thus begun to uſe our ſelves, the Name of God and of all his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes and Perfections was an inſignificant thing to us, we underſtood little or nothing by it, and no more affected with it moſt times than our Statues of Wood or Stone would be. We might hear much talk, and read much of God indeed, or his excellent Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Attributes, but little know what they meant. We apprehended better and more, were much more affected with ſome little particular kindneſs of any honeſt or
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:94938:109"/> good Neighbour, than with the infinite Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y and Goodneſs of God, who is the conſtant Cauſe and Author to us, and to all things of all the good things we all have and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy.</p>
                  <p>Moreover in ſome Prayers, as ſecret Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, where we may have time to apply our Thoughts to what we pleaſe, we do not only tranſiently (which if frequent will do a great deal) but alſo fixedly and for a longer time attend ſometimes to one or more of theſe infinite Perfections of God when we acknowledge them; whence a more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar diſcovery and clear apprehenſion of the Greatneſs thereof; inſomuch that the Soul may break forth into Raptures of ſutable Paſſions, that is, great and ſudden Violences thereof. As for Example, If a Man contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating the Power of God ſhould attend to the Greatneſs and Vaſtneſs, Excellency and Nobleneſs, and Strangeneſs of the Nature of things he hath made, were it but only of the indefinitely extended material World, much more of the intellectual or the World of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. Or contemplating his Wiſdom ſhould attend to this, that all things that we and all the rational Creatures in Heaven and Earth know by little Parcels, and ſucceſſively to Eternity it ſelf, are all preſent at once to that infinite Underſtanding; or contemplating his Goodneſs, ſhould take notice of the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

A Mixture, I ſay, for the moſt part, for they may alſo propoſe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Juſtice of their Deſires, and what pleaſeth God, and is for his Honour. Though this Apprehenſion or Conceit too may oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times proceed from <hi>ultimate Self-Love,</hi> and they are willing to think a Thing juſt, and that it pleaſeth God, only becauſe they would have it ſo. For ſuch Prayers as theſe, as there may be ſomething in them which may have ſome Tendency to make Men good (as meerly acknowledging of God's Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes and our Dependence upon him) ſo there is much more in them which will make Men bad and wicked.</p>
                  <p>Again, A Man may be erroneous and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken in many Parts of his Prayer through Pride and Conceitedneſs or Superſtition. So he may acknowledge God's goodneſs, and thank him for his being made by him very holy and good in general, when he is not ſo; nay, ſometimes not even in thoſe particulars he mentions; and that which he takes for Holineſs may be done out of Pride, Vain-Glory, or ſome other baſe End. As the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee thanked God he was not an Extortioner and unjuſt, when he was, though not in the ſame Inſtances with the Publican, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:94938:113"/> Cuſtom, and taking perhaps ſome what to abate and conceal it; or when, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> he was not an Extortioner, Unjuſt, Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer in the external Actions, or internal ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; yet it might be only to ſave his Credit or Reputation, or that he might appear more holy than the Publican, and not be as the Common People of the Earth, but be ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to them: In all which there was n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Holineſs at all, but only Wickedneſs: Or fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, if he were truly ſo much better than the Publican in theſe things; yet he might be as bad or worſe in as many or more things ſuch as were Pride, Vain-Glory, Envy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that therefore he looked upon himſelf much more holy in <hi>general,</hi> than he was, and thanked God for it too.</p>
                  <p>And ſo alſo a Man might be erroneous in his Confeſſion of his Sins, and through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged Weakneſs, Ignorance, Superſtition, or ſome Paſſions, judge thoſe Sins, which are not ſo, or greater than they are, For which Reaſons how neceſſary is it for us to be wiſe, diſcreet, to know our Selves to be in the Truth before we ſuffer any Affections to be engaged. Some even Religious and highly uſeful affections when guided by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and truth, may when they are blind or not directed thereby, lead us into ſometimes hurtful errors and miſtakes, and diſpoſe our Judgments to Judge falſly. A very great
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:94938:113"/> hatred, contempt and grief at our ſelves for ſin in general, or ſome more notorious ſin in particular may make us judge worſe of our ſelves than in truth we deſerve: as we but too often do by others, when we are poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the paſſions of Hatred, Anger, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge againſt them. And becauſe it is very rare but that through ſelf-love and flattery we err on the other hand, therefore this is the leſs ſuſpected. So ſometimes ſome very great paſſion of admiration, honour, love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for ſome one attribute in God, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to magnifie it, may make men judge that to be in God which is inconſiſtent with ſome other attribute or perfection in him, and aſcribe to him not only bare falſities, but myſterious contradictions. So, for Example, a man's deſire to advance the unlimitedneſs of God's power may lead him to judge, that he may juſtly, if he will, make all his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be miſerable. And ſo ſome piouſly, but unwarily, to magnifie the mercy of God in our Redemption, have ſpoken, and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to think, that God or the Divine Nature it ſelf did really even leſſen and abate it ſelf when for the recovery of miſerable Man-kind, it did extraordinarily and Hypoſtatically unite it ſelf to an humane nature. But this is a little Digreſſion.</p>
                  <p>Again, A Man may pray Words only, and have no ſenſe hardly of what he ſaith; and
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:94938:114"/> yet this is uſed to be called Prayer, though according to our Definition it is not. A Man may alſo pray and underſtand what he ſaith, but yet have no Affection ſtirring, no Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, Honour, Reverence, Love, Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to God, no Deſires for the things which he mentions with his Lips or conceives with his Mind, no Truſt or Faith in God, not one jot of inward Sorrow and true Grief for his Sins, as Sins, or Reſolution to do ſo no more, but to abſtain from them and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake them, and to be obedient to God for the future: I ſay a Man may ſay Words and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand Senſe, and both very excellent too; and yet have none of theſe Paſſions and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections excited, he may not be touched therewith, but be perfectly cold. And yet theſe are uſually called Prayers; which as it is true they have ſome Tendency and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to do ſome good (even the very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printing ſuch Words and Senſes in our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory;) ſo they may ſometimes do as much or more harm; and ſo either not make us any whit the better, or make us the worſe. For they may by uſe make us formal, that is to ſay Words without either Senſe or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, or with <hi>them,</hi> but without any Affection at all; more to disjoyn thoſe things which otherwiſe would be more naturally conjoyn'd, and to be well content herewith too, and think we have done well enough,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:94938:114"/> and make us look no further. If we have but after any manner ſaid our Prayers, though never ſo ignorantly and coldly, we have done our Duty, we are well ſatisfied.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ler we ſhall do it ſtill; whereas we ought all of us when we pray to heed, underſtand, and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend to the utmoſt of our Power and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility what it is we ſay; and eſpecially its Truth and Goodneſs, and then to ſtir up and ſtrengthen our ſutable Affections; and if we find our ſelves dull, languid, inapprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, to ſend up to God a hearty Ejaculation, that he would by his Spirit illuminate our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, quicken, enliven and ſtrengthen our Affections and Reſolutions.</p>
                  <p>Again, as I have formerly ſaid, Though we pray daily, and it may be indifferently well, with Underſtanding and Affection; yet we may ſo conſtantly both <hi>inordinately and immoderately</hi> engage our Affections all the day after about other Objects beſides our Duty, and thoſe things which diſpoſe us to the Practice thereof, without any Reference of them to their due End, and without any Government or Moderation, that the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of our Prayer may be ſometimes quite prevented or extinguiſhed, and our Affections be upon other things, and our Inclinations to them as unduely as ever they were. Indeed
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:94938:115"/> generally and for the moſt part, I think that our Prayers being performed with under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and affection, have ſome tendency in them to make us better, or keep us from being worſe. We ſhould generally be worle, (though now not good) if ſuch our Prayers ſhould be altogether neglected.</p>
                  <p>Finally, It is poſſible ſometimes for our Prayers to be ſo performed, as that they may many other wayes beſides that which was a little before mentioned, do us more harm than good, and render us worſe than if we prayed not at all. As if we be ſo vainly conceited of our Prayers, and of our ſelves for them, as to think our ſelves very good and acceptable to God, let our Lives and Actions be all the day after what they will; and that our Prayers make ſatisfaction for our Sins; and particularly, that it is attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment enough whiningly to confeſs them in general or particular Terms, and to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge our Weakneſs and Badneſs of our Hearts, and ſo to be very well content to be alwayes weak and ſinful too; and think it far better to pray and not to live well and conſcientiouſly in the moſt conſiderable and frequent Actions of Life, than to live con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiouſly, righteouſly and honeſtly, and that with reſpect to God too, as pleaſing him; but not to pray, though very erroneouſly, and indiſcreetly, nay, inſincerely and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critically
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:94938:115"/> (as is before ſaid) and therefore wickedly; Whereas this laſt is a Means to the former, and in it doth its chief and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal, though not only Uſe and Benefit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, as we ſhall hereafter mention.</p>
                  <p>But yet, by no Means would I, becauſe of this or ſuch like ineffectual Uſe or Abuſes which may be of Prayer, have Men think of neglecting or throwing it quite away; but rather to betake themſelves ſeriouſly to uſe and perform it as they ought, and to have a Care of all Formality, Conceitedneſs, falſe Opinion of Prayers, and to be careful to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them with their conſtant Care, Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, Watchfulneſs, endeavour to live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to them, or according to all good Conſcience all the day after, in all their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; finally, to perform them according to the Directions hereafter.</p>
                  <p>This for the firſt way how our Prayers tend to make us better, and to preſerve us ſtill in what Goodneſs we have obtained, that we do not go backward and relapſe, but go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and make progreſs in Goodneſs; (<hi>viz.</hi>) by being an occaſion of the actual Exerciſe thereof, or of thoſe things which are very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Means for that End.</p>

                  <p>II. OUr Praying will preſerve us in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and make us better by Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion. That is, by bringing to our Minds either our Duty in general, or any particular Duties to God, our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, or our Selves, or thoſe things which are Means to diſpoſe and engage us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Such as are the infinite Wiſdom of God, his all-ſeeing and comprehending Knowledge, that he is the ſearcher of Hearts, and knows perfectly and better than our ſelves the beſt and worſt of our Thoughts, Counſels, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, Tendencies, Inclinations, Choices, and Delights of our Hearts: He knows both our Honeſty, Simplicity and Sincerity, and alſo our Partiality, Hypocriſie and ſecret Badneſs not known or perceived by others at all, nor by our ſelves, perhaps, till we be of an adviſed, calm, humble, modeſt and ſincere Temper: ſuch are further the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Goodneſs of God, his particular Mercy or Bounty, his Juſtice and Severity, our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence upon God and our abſolute Need of him, that we cannot be nor hope for any good thing with any Reaſon but from him. Such is his infinite uncontroulable Power, that he can turn us out of Being, or into
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:94938:116"/> Miſery here and hereafter; take from us our Lives, Strengths, Healths, Riches, Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Parts or Gifts, which we may uſe lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, wickedly proudly, when he pleaſeth; make us ſneaking, ſickly, poor, contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, Sots or D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nces in this Life, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after turn us into everlaſting Puniſhment, without Repentance and Amendment.</p>
                  <p>Such again are when we confeſs our Sins, our Sins themſelves, what they are, their Vileneſs, Iniquity, Folly, Shamefulneſs; But the Peace and Satisfaction of Conſcience ariſing from a free and hearty Confeſſion of Sin, and Senſe of an internal, ſincere, uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd Hatred and Contempt of it, and a firm and generous Reſolution of being good for the future: I ſay, our praying frequently will bring ſuch things as theſe are into our Minds, bring them to our Obſervation and Memory, and be a cauſe too of their coming to our Minds upon any Occaſion of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves without our Direction. Whereas o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe we ſhould have never, it may be, once had thought of ſome of thoſe things, and of others of them very rarely and ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And ſo we ſee by Experience, that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally thoſe who moſt neglect this Duty of Prayer, publick, private, ſecret, ſet and fixed, or at leaſt occaſional and ejaculatory, perpetually only employ themſelves about other matters; and more rarely think of
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:94938:117"/> theſe things, and ſuch like. Some never have them come into their Thoughts all their Lives time; others think not of them not in a Day, a Week, a longer time; and when they do, it is very tranſiently and ſlightly, and theſe excellent things are ſoon turned out, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not liked. God, and their Duty, and their Happineſs, and things that belong hereto are not in all their Thoughts ſometimes; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially this is ſeen in thoſe who if they ſhould not have Time, or Ability, or Opportunity to pray in private or ſecret (which is an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Excuſe hereafter to be anſwered;) yet ſurely want not the Opportunity of the Publick, where Prayers are provided for them, and ſomething elſe: But yet ſottiſhly and careleſly they ſit and loll at Home, and it may be do worſe, or idly ramble abroad. We ſee that theſe are generally Perſons void of the moſt ordinary Degree of Goodneſs, even of Humanity it ſelf, who care for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God nor Man; wretched Brutes! who when God out of his unſpeakable Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs hath ſo highly honoured them with a capacity of knowing and worſhipping, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring, loving and obeying him, of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation and communion with himſelf, yet will not make uſe thereof; but impudently by this their Carriage in Particular, dare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim to the World, that they care not for him, and will have nothing to do with him,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:94938:117"/> and wilfully deſcend ſo far to be like the Beaſts. But God will have to do with them, and Time will come, when neither God nor Man will pity their intolerable Torment, and they ſhall howl under the juſt Wrath of that God whom they would not love or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. And all honeſt and but tolerably well minded Men, that have but any reſpect for their Creator (much more Chriſtians) and have not caſt away all Senſe of him, ought after neighbourly Advice and Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, if they will not amend, to have an Abhorrency of ſuch Perſons as ſuch, as well as Pity for them, as capable of better things.</p>
                  <p>But now to proceed, The oftner our Duty in general, or our particular Duties come to our Thoughts, the more likely it is we ſhall practiſe them; The oftner our Faults come to our Minds, and we remember them, the more likely we ſhall avoid and mend them; The oftner we think of God but in general, much more in particular of his Power, all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing Knowledge, his Goodneſs, his Mercy, Juſtice, conſequently Heaven, Hell, the more ſurely ſhall we be diſpoſed to do our Duty, and have a Care of and abſtain from all Sin. Our Prayers therefore being the Occaſion of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch things as theſe are into our Thoughts, and of furniſhing our Memory therewith, and of their often actually appearing and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring

The ſerious and frequent admiring therefore and loving particularly in God his Holineſs and Righteouſneſs, will
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:94938:119"/> diſpoſe us to an imitation of him therein. The reaſon why we do not ſee Men's Prayers do them this way any great good (though, I think, they rarely perform them ſo badly, but they would be worſe if they did not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them at all) is becauſe they perform their Prayers ſo ſeldom, or ſo ſuperficially, coldly or heartleſly. Sometimes they pray only with their Lips, when their Hearts are far from what they do; they are cold and dull, not at all warmed or touched. The very loving God for his Benefits only <hi>in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular to us,</hi> will diſpoſe us to Imitation, if we do but attend to or remember, that to imitate him will certainly pleaſe him, which Love diſpoſeth us unto. And that our Love and Thankfulneſs to God for his Benefits in our Prayers may more certainly have this excellent Effect of Imitation of him, and conſequently being holy; it will be very good when we have acknowledged God's Favours, to ask our ſelves ſeriouſly, what we ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn him again, how we ſhall pleaſe him: and then to anſwer our ſelves, by being like himſelf in all manner of Righteouſneſs and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and hating all manner of Sin and Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</p>
                  <p>We ſee alſo by Experience, that we imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate thoſe with whom we much and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently converſe, and have a great Opinion of; we do as they do, we entertain our
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:94938:120"/> ſelves with the ſame Thoughts, Affections, Actions. And ſo it is with Minds; who fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and heartily converſe with God, that is, have him the Object of their Thoughts and Affections in Prayer, and have an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Opinion of him (as who hath not?) they generally are more like him; I am ſure at leaſt are much diſpoſed thereto. Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence alſo teacheth us, that Men who think of God, are much according to their Notions of him, as they think of him and apprehend him, And therefore if they look upon God as a powerful, arbitrary, angerful Being, ſo he be not ſo to themſelves, and they be but ſecure; they themſelves are apt to be ſo too, and oft-times actually are ſo. They contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe who worſhip God principally for and take notice of his Univerſal Goodneſs and Love, as his principal and only abſolute Perfection, and dearly love and admire him as Omniſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and Omnipotent Love, who, though he can do what he liſt, doth always what is beſt: Theſe, I ſay, are apt to be of a univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally, generouſly benign Temper to all, not arbitrary, partial, but good to every one, as is beſt for the general good, or for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</p>
                  <p>Again, Our Prayers by Converſe with ſpiritual and great Objects, ſpiritualizing and widening our Minds, do make us more capable of apprehending and imitating of
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:94938:120"/> God's Perfections, eſpecially his Holineſs or Univerſal Righteouſneſs.</p>

                  <p>IV. A Fourth Way how our Prayers do make us good and better, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve us in Goodneſs, is more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly by bringing to our Minds the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our Petitions being granted. We cannot pray for or deſire any thing of God with any Hopes of Succeſs, but upon the Condition of our being good; the degrees of our Faith and Hope, are to anſwer the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of our Goodneſs. And this way is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to that part of Prayer called Petition. We all of us naturally know and believe that God is holy and juſt, and that he governs all the World for its greateſt good, and that it is for its greateſt good, and therefore one of his Laws or Rules, to reward the good, and to puniſh the bad, and that one proper way of Puniſhment which God may uſe, is to take away the good things that wicked Men have already, or to croſs their deſires, that they ſhould not proſper or ſucceed in what they would have; and if we believe this, we can have no Hopes of Succeſs, or that our Petitions ſhould be granted ſo far as we know our ſelves to be wicked; and if we have no
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:94938:121"/> Hopes to ſpeed without repentance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, either we ſhall never give ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſuſpected before. Hence it comes to paſs that wicked men whoſe Conſciences fly i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I know ſometimes Conſcience may be very forgetful, dull, partial, erroneous through want of Sincerity and Strength in Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:94938:121"/> and Men may be very conſident in their Petitions too, when really they are at the ſame time very bad, and that even in their very Prayers they are performing; and therefore that the Prayers of ſuch perſons do neither ſuppoſe, nor make them good: but yet for the moſt part it is otherwiſe. Eſpecially when mens ſins are more plain and manifeſt, and the evil which they lye under, or fear, is very great, and ſeems no other way remediable but by God's help: then their Conſciences will be awakened to a ſuſpition of themſelves, to reflection, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination and confeſſion, and to ſome kind of promiſe or reſolution of amendment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they will have the confidence to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs any deſire to God. They are aſhamed and afraid without ſomething at leaſt of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and begging of God's pardon to requeſt any thing from him, whoſe moſt juſt Laws they have negligently or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuouſly violated, and whom they know to be ſo juſt as no more to approve and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit the guilty without repentance, then to neglect or condemn the innocent and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Of the firſt ſort of men were the Phariſees, who were generally very bad men, but probably did not always know their own badneſs and hypocriſie.

                  <p>But then they inform Men too (which is the End why I have brought them) that if Men hope to be heard by God, and to have
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:94938:125"/> their Prayers granted, they muſt be good, and not live in the practice of known Sin, or through Hypocriſie, or Inſincerity, Lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Prevalency of ſome Luſt above their Duty, wilfully be ignorant whether they live in any Sin or no, or ſlatter themſelves in general they do not. And thoſe Men who know thus much by natural Conſcience, Reaſon, the Scriptures, and often attend to it, (which are moſt Men in ſome Degree or other, though not all) if they betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to pray to God for the removal of any Evil, or the granting of them any good, will firſt be apt to reſlect upon their Lives and Actions, and promiſe unto God Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Reformation of what they know to be bad in themſelves, and to beg his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, that they may with Hopes of Succeſs pray to him and effectually obtain their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires: and to do this often and conſtantly, ſurely will be an excellent Means for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving Men from all Sin, nay, to make them more ſincerely, vigorouſly, conſtantly and univerſally better.</p>

But what may or can be beloved with a more ardent and intenſe degree of it than God? 'Than God, I ſay, when we conceive him to be infinite love it ſelf (for God is Love) to be univerſally good to all things which he hath
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:94938:129"/> made, eternally, immutably, and in infinite degree; inſomuch that there never can be any one thing in the World that is not the Effect of his love and goodneſs to the whole World, even his permiſſion and puniſhment of Sin it ſelf: than God, I ſay, who is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controulable and infinite in Power too, and can do what he pleaſeth, upon whom all things depend, and from whom they have all, and that no longer than pleaſeth him, and yet is infinite Love and Goodneſs; What can or may be more beloved than ſuch a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as he is? I ſay, what <hi>may be</hi> loved by us more ardently than God? not, what is ſo? Our minds may be very ſenſual and dull in their apprehenſions, very much corrupted, degenerate and debaſed in their affections, ſo that we may not apprehend theſe ſpiritual Excellencies, nor have any or but very little inclinations to them or affections for them in any other.</p>
                  <p>We may our ſelves be ſo ill-natured as not much to be taken or pleaſed with all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of others kindneſs and good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, unleſs it be to our ſelves; nor then neither, unleſs they be able as well as kind, and can do ſomething for us, as well as will it: which is a ſign, that 'tis the perſons power more than his goodneſs that we love or eſteem, and his power too only to do us good. I ſay, a man may be of this dull,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:94938:129"/> ſelfiſh, brutiſh Nature, and be pleaſed prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally with power and other things, not at all or little with loving or good nature. This man indeed in his Prayers will have little love for the Univerſal Goodneſs and loving Kindneſs of God, and conſequently have little pleaſure or delight in his Prayers upon that account. But I do affirm, That there are Souls who have the greateſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency and pangs of love and affection to God, and dearly embrace him, and unite themſelves to him thus conſidered; and that theſe therefore find in their Prayers where they put forth this their affection, the moſt raviſhing Joy and Pleaſure. Nay, I affirm, That even the worſt of men that are the moſt ſenſual, carnal, dull and ill-natured have Souls capable of being more ſpiritual and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined in their underſtandings and affections: and of being infinitely in love with the boundleſs goodneſs and love of God, and more than with any other thing, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently of a proportionable pleaſure and ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>The ſame is to be ſaid concerning Joy in God, who is thus infinite in love and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to all his Creatures, and hope or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident perſwaſion, and conſequent acquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence and repoſe of Soul in God for the Univerſal good of all. When the Soul upon the aſſurance and evidence that all things in

                  <p>Further, In Prayer we do not only make acknowledgment of God, admire, honour, love, rejoyce, hope in him for his Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in reference to all his Creatures in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral: but alſo in reference to our ſelves. We admire his great goodneſs, particularly to our ſelves, and love him for it, and rejoyce in the preſent poſſeſſion, and in good hopes of the future (perhaps eternal) enjoyment of it. Which paſſions generally are in moſt men more piercing and ſtrong than upon the account of God's infinite Perfections (and eſpecially his goodneſs) referred to all his Creatures; but indeed ſhould not be ſo. Nevertheleſs it is good for us to be deeply affected with Admiration, Love, Joy, Hope of God's Goodneſs to our ſelves in any kind
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:94938:130"/> expreſſed; not in oppoſition to others good, but as one ſingle Inſtance and Example of God's Univerſal Goodneſs to all, which we moſt clearly apprehend. For, is God ſo good to us in particular? he is the ſame to all and every of his Creatures as much as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the common good of all, to ſome more to ſome leſs than our ſelves. In Prayer we, I ſay, thus take notice of and ſtir up our love to God for his love to us, or thankfulneſs to God for all his paſt benefits, among which are his promiſes of future good things; we rejoyce in him for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and we hope and repoſe our ſelves on him for the future.</p>
                  <p>Now theſe very Paſſions and Affections themſelves in our Souls are the moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and pleaſing to them, as is the very thinking and contemplation of the Infinite Power, Wiſdom, and eſpecially Goodneſs of God.

                     </gap>lf of the ſincerity of his amendment, ſo far he may be confident God will grant this his Prayer. For beſides that even by reaſon it ſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out expreſs promiſe of the Goſpel it might be very probable; by the expreſs promiſe of the Goſpel it is moſt undoubted and certain. Even Reaſon it ſelf would judge it more probable, if it were informed that it is done for ſo excellent a perſon's ſake as Jeſus Chriſt was: But then moreover, I ſay it is the moſt expreſs promiſe of the Goſpel, and one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of the principal things it came to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint men withal, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the World to himſelf,</hi> and that by repentance and faith in Chriſt's Name, <hi>that is, by doing all our duty for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as commanded from God by Chriſt;</hi> men might have remiſſion of ſins. And ſo again, if any man deſires and prays from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of his ſoul for God's grace in general to repent, and that he may forſake at laſt all ſin, and become a new man, giving up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to obey God, being afraid or weary of a ſinful wicked life, as a thing unaccountable, unreaſonable; or in particular, if he prays for ſtrength to mortifie any luſt, to leave any ſin, to obtain any grace or virtue, he may be confident he ſhall be heard in ſome degree or other, ſome time or other. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:94938:132"/> God might not hear us preſently, but excite us and ſtrengthen us to continue our Prayers more earneſtly, whereby we gain dependance upon God, humility, nay a greater thirſt after the thing we ask, and conſequently indeed a greater degree of it. I ſay, for pardon and grace if unfeignedly and heartily asked and humbly begged of God, we may be confident we ſhall be heard; both becauſe it ſeems reaſonable, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath more expreſly promiſed them in the Scripture. But as for other even ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual good things, as natural parts or gifts of underſtanding, memory, utterance or the like, theſe it is but probable that it is the beſt God ſhould beſtow them upon us in ſome degree. And as for external good things, ſuch as health, ſtrength, beauty, riches, honour or good name, plenty or competen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, deliverance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we have leſs probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity ſtill, although ſo much as to encourage us ſufficiently to propound our deſires to God too. And therefore here our hope will be more or leſs ſtrong, unleſs God hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly by certain revelation promiſed any of them to us, as it was in <hi>David's</hi> caſe, when he was perſecuted by <hi>Saul</hi> and by other Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and his life ſought after. God had certainly by his Prophets, and probably to himſelf by Inſpiration promiſed he ſhould be King and ſucceed <hi>Saul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:94938:132"/>
                  <p>Now ſee how this faith effectually produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth in the ſoul of a good man Eaſe, Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Repoſe, and Acquieſcence which are the moſt pleaſurable and delicious things. Whenever he wanteth any thing he propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his deſires to God, and firſt believes that if it be juſt for God to give, and him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, he ſhall have it; and this is all he deſires, nor would he ask any thing upon other terms; wherefore he knows his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire is fully granted, he hath what he would have alwaies; which ſurely muſt needs be followed with the greateſt ſatisfaction of ſpirit. He is not any of thoſe ſelf-willed, proud, peeviſh perſons who will not be content but are impatient, if God doth not give them every particular good thing they propound or think of, whether he in wiſdom ſees it fit and juſt to be beſtowed upon them or no: As he is not one of thoſe careleſs ones who never ask any thing from God at all, but muddle on in their own contrivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and endeavours, being infinitely ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous they ſhould and fretting themſelves when they do not ſucceed. He is none of thoſe who never make any reflection upon the Infinite Wiſdom, the Univerſal Goodneſs and Righteouſneſs of God, and conſequently the perfect Juſtice and Reaſonableneſs of all the Divine Appointments, be they what they will: But in all his Prayers eſpecially
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:94938:133"/> he conſtantly minds, he firmly believes, he perfectly acquieſceth and rejoyceth in them, whereby he not only prevents all anguiſh and vexation to which ſolicitude and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration expoſe the proud and negligent of God, but puts alſo his mind into a conſtant ſtate of repoſe, ſatisfaction and joy.</p>
                  <p>But then further for ſome things which he wants, he doth but with that ſincerity, fervency and aſſiduity that he ought or as the things deſerve, beſeech them from God, and he is firmly and confidently perſwaded (not raſhly, but) from Reaſon and Divine Revelation, that he ſhall have them. Such are they which I have before mentioned of pardon for Chriſt's ſake, either in general or for any particular ſin he may have been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken with, upon his ſincere diſallowance thereof, his contempt and hatred of himſelf for it; and of God's grace and ſtrength to ſubdue any luſt or corruption, or in general to mend and reform himſelf in ſome degree or other. That he ſhall receive theſe things if he ask them as he ought he is confident and fully perſwaded. And whatever men that are wicked, ſenſual, worldly, may think of theſe things he deſires, the holy and divine as well as wiſe ſoul accounts them ſo great, that as for all other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters before mentioned, ſuch as are Parts and Gifts, Riches, Plenty, Honour, Health,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:94938:133"/> Strength, Senſual Pleaſures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he is very indifferent for his part to them, ſo he may but obtain the former, of which he is ſo firmly aſſured, if he but ask them as he ought. Nay, he knows or may conſider and attend that they indeed ſo far as he ſhould and would deſire them even for his own good are comprehended in or conſequent upon the former. For if our ſins be pardoned, we in God's favour, which we are ſo far as we are good, what may we not expect from God and be confidently aſſured of, if it be good for us? It is juſt, we know, with God by reaſon, and God hath ſaid it by Revelation, that God ſhould diſpoſe of ſuch portions of all good things whatſoever to good men, as may be moſt even for their good. God doth take the care of them that upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming their duty they ſhall have from him what is for their proper good; and ſure it is their wiſeſt way to leave him to be judge. Now how full of Repoſe, Acquieſcence, Peace, Eaſe and Satisfaction of Spirit doth this Faith and Belief make the Soul? If a man ſincerely, fervently, aſſiduouſly begs of God he may be good and do his duty, he ſhall certainly have ſtrength ſo to be, and ſo to do; and then ſo far as he is good he ſhall have whatever is for his good. What would a man deſire more? And if a man hath all he deſires or can deſire, and believes and
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:94938:134"/> hopes, nay knows ſo much (all which a good man may exerciſe and act in Prayer) wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Who would not be a good man that he may thus pray? and who would not pray that he may enjoy ſo great a happineſs? who would be ſo weak and fooliſh as for the indulgence and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of ſome pitiful mean and baſe appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, for the preſent enjoyment of ſome vile and unreaſonable luſt or ſin, forego and quit all his faith, confidence and hope in God and the conſequent delight, acquieſcence, caſe, peace and joy of ſoul upon all occaſions, being aſhamed ever to think of God, much more to addreſs himſelf to him or ask any thing at his hand though he ſhould be in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo great diſtreſs?

                  <p>
                     <hi>David</hi> was a truly excellent Example of
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:94938:135"/> this uſefulneſs and benefit of Prayer. It ſeems to have been his moſt uſual Cordial which he often took to ſupport his fainting and tired ſoul, to quell and compoſe his vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, fears, diſturbances, to alleviate and remove his grief and ſadneſs. We'l give an inſtance or two. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 42. Firſt he mentions his preſent ſad and miſerable condition in many reſpects, as his being baniſhed out of his Country (it is likely, by <hi>Saul</hi>) and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally from the Publick Worſhip of his God for which he panted and thirſted, <hi>Oh when ſhall I come and appear before God? Verſe</hi> 1, 2, 4, 6. Then his Enemies contempt and inſulting over him, and eſpecially their not believing that he was ſo great a Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of God's, but rather that God had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected him or minded him not, <hi>Verſe</hi> 3, 10. But to comfort and chear himſelf, he prays to God, and is very confident God will hear him (as he had reaſon) and cheerlily chides himſelf, <hi>Ver. 8, 9, 11. Yet the Lord will command his loving kindneſs in the day time, and in the night his Song ſhall be with me, and my Prayer to the God of my life;</hi> that is, yet I will pray to my God, and I truſt and know he will give me cauſe to rejoyce and praiſe him by his hearing of me at all times. <hi>I will ſay unto God my Rock, why haſt thou forſaken me, why go I mourning becauſe of the oppreſſion of the Enemy?</hi> And <hi>Verſe 11. Why art thou caſt
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:94938:136"/> down O my Soul, why art thou ſo diſquieted within me? hope thou in God, for I ſhall yet praiſe him who is the health of my Countenance and my God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, The very next <hi>Pſalm (viz.</hi>) 43. he prays very paſſionately to God for deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from his Enemies, who were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciful, deceitful, unjuſt; and that God would bring him back again to enjoy his Publick Worſhip in his Temple, from which he ſeems now baniſhed; <hi>Oh ſend out</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>thy light and thy truth</hi> (that is, perhaps, thy enlightning or rejoycing truth in perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thy Promiſes thou haſt made to me) <hi>let them lead me, let them bring me unto thy holy hill Sion</hi> (the place where the Temple was built) <hi>and to thy Tabernacles,</hi> that is, the Temple built inſtead of the Tabernacle, where God eſpecially manifeſted himſelf, or where were very ſpecial effects of his Power and Preſence. Then he Vows unto God that with exceeding joy and thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he would make uſe of and improve that favour, <hi>Verſ 4. Then will I go unto the Altar of God, unto God my exceeding joy,</hi> &amp;c. and then <hi>Verſe</hi> the laſt, he is full of good hope and firm confidence that God who was the health of his countenance (that is, the cauſe of all his joy and of his content which uſeth to be ſhewed by ones healthful aſpect and countenance) and who was his God, would
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:94938:136"/> hear his Petition at laſt, (<hi>viz.</hi>) that he ſhould praiſe him therefore, and that publickly in the Temple.</p>
                  <p>Again, in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 55. he deſcribes the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable plight that he was in, becauſe of the conſtant Machinations and plots of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, deceitful and bloody men, (as 'tis v. 23.) nay of thoſe who had been his Friends and Confidents, who had forſaken him in his diſgrace and adverſity (as it is uſual) and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned him, <hi>Verſe</hi> 12. his Enemies contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved even to take away his Life, they oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him with Accuſations and Reproaches, and wrathfully hated him, whence he was full of Complaints and Mourning, in ſo much that there was likelihood of his death there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; which (though another ſenſe may be too) he expreſſeth in <hi>Verſe 4, 5,</hi> by <hi>his heart being pained and the terrours of death fallen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and fearfulneſs and trembling coming upon him, and horrour overwhelming him.</hi> But then the courſe he takes is to pray to God with hope and truſt in him. By theſe he reſeues himſelf from this ſadneſs and grief of Soul, and eaſes, comforts and ſatisfies it, <hi>Verſe 16. As for me I will call upon God, and the Lord ſhall ſave me.</hi> Verſe 17. <hi>Evening and Morning and at Noon-day</hi> (that is very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently) he would <hi>pray and cry aloud, and God ſhould hear his voice.</hi> And <hi>Verſe 22. Caſt thy burden,</hi> that is what grieves thee, <hi>upon
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:94938:137"/> the Lord and he ſhall ſuſtain thee. He ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuffer the righteous to be moved;</hi> that is, himſelf to be fruſtrated of his hope.</p>

                  <p>A Third Way how Prayer is for our<note place="margin">III.</note> eaſe, comfort and ſatisfaction of mind, is by reflection upon our ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving performed our moſt juſt and reaſonable duty to God, and upon ſome more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary good qualities in our ſelves that may upon this occaſion appear; as in general up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our ability for and our good will to this duty or performance; that we are able and diſpoſed for ſuch excellent things as are in Prayer: more particularly that our minds are ſo able to converſe with ſpiritual things and future, yea eternal, and to be affected with them; ſuch as God, his Nature and Actions; our own Souls, their Actions and Inclinations, the State after Death, the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Life hereafter; That we can take notice of God's Perfections, acknowledge them, really honour him, love and reſolve to obey him, to put our truſt in him and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon him; that we can take notice of and grieve ſincerely and heartily for the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularities of our Actions, and our bad and ſinful Temper and Inclinations; be pleaſed
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:94938:137"/> with, deſire, pray for Virtue and Grace; that we can think of, attend to and be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and much affected with things of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture reward and miſery, Heaven and Hell; that we are not ſenſual, dull, worldly, earthly-minded perſons, who can mind nothing but ſenſible, preſent and worldly matters for this ſhort life.</p>
                  <p>All men are naturally inclined to believe and confuſedly ſee that ſuch ſpiritual and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture things as we have mentioned, are more excellent, more perfect (that is, of more good effect) than ſenſible and preſent worldly things; and conſequently that it is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter perfection and excellency in a man to know, contemplate, be affected with thoſe former than theſe latter, to have his mind converſant with and employed about them: which is one reaſon why the perſons who profeſs and really live or ſeem to live ſuch a life are generally honoured and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced.</p>
                  <p>Further, A man after ſuch a performance as a diſcreet and affectionate Prayer may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect not only upon his <hi>ability and ſufficiency</hi> for ſuch excellent things, but alſo upon his <hi>love to them and good will to them, his eſteem for them, that he actually is ſo affected, and at that particular time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Particularly after an underſtanding and affectionate Prayer, it is very acceptable to
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:94938:138"/> make reflection that he hath at that time performed ſo noble and excellent a part of his duty, and that which more immediately reſpects God; that he is not altogether care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of God, lives without him, forgets him days without number; but that he hath honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him by his expreſs acknowledgments of his Infinite Perfections; by humbly petition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him for what he wants and what is good and juſt for him; by rendring him hearty thanks and actually loving him for his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold favours, even for all he hath or ever had, for any degree of Holineſs, for Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Wiſdom, Parts, Gifts, Riches or Competency, Reputation, Friends, Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from Enemies, Health, Strength, Power, Opportunity or Advantage to do Good, Peace, Joy, Satisfaction, Happineſs here, Hopes and Aſſurance of greater Perfection and Happineſs after Death and parting with all here; and for all his boundleſs Goodneſs and benignity of his Nature to all his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: that he hath honoured him by an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured but juſt Truſt and Confidence in him, by a free ſubmiſſion of his Will to his Will in all things, and conforming of it chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully thereunto, to do all he commands him, and to be in any condition he appoints or diſpoſeth: that he hath honoured him by a ready and free confeſſion of, and piercing hearty grief for, and inward deteſtation of
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:94938:138"/> all his unreaſonable Violations of his Juſt and Holy Laws made known either by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or Revelation, by Natural Conſcience or God's Word, and conſequently of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Laws of Righteouſneſs: that he hath honoured him by asking from him as the only ſupreme, juſt, and yet propitious Judge of the World, pardon and forgiveneſs for Chriſt's ſake that he would not puniſh him, but moſt of all by importunately begging his ſupervenient Grace, Strength and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, his Aſſiſtance one way or other that he might not Offend or do contrary to his Duty any more in any kind. I ſay, when a man hath performed ſo noble and excellent a part of his Duty towards God which tends ſo much to make him Divine and Perfect, it will not ſoon out of his mind, he will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reflecting upon it, and that cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a high degree of joy and ſatisfaction of Spirit, and he will humbly give unfeigned Thanks to God for making him capable of ſuch a noble and excellent Employment, ſo raviſhing and delicious to himſelf, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially which will render him ſo benign, uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and profitable to the World, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to God; for giving him the means of and effectually bringing him to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and uſe of ſuch an excellent Life; and he will wiſh all men may be ſo happy as to know and partake thereof.</p>
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:94938:139"/>
                  <p>There are Two things among other which make a man very ſenſible of the excellency of this part of his Duty, and conſequently to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from thence more ſatisfaction and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is its compare with other parts of our Duty reſpecting our Neighbour. It ſeems more excellent than that to love ones Neighbour, that is, any rational Creature capable of any good from us. To wiſh well heartily to him, to be charitable, juſt, grateful, compaſſionate, or to ſhew any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Inſtance of Love to him, though it be excellent, yet ſeems as much inferiour to that of our abſolute love to God (not as only good to one, but to all the Univerſe) as our Neighbour, nay all the World are inferiour to God. To wiſh well to or deſire any good thing for God we may not, becauſe it ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth ſome good thing abſent or poſſible to be abſent from him; an abſent good is the proper object of <hi>deſire:</hi> but we may will and rejoyce in his infinite happineſs and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which he actually poſſeſſeth; we may <hi>will</hi> a preſent good. And this ought to be ſo much more eſteemed (if we compare them) than the love of our Neighbour, as God is capable of more happineſs and felicity than all his Creatures, which is infinitely. All the World is a little thing, a Nothing to him; and his Being and Happineſs conſequently is
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:94938:139"/> infinitely to be preferr'd before that of all his Creatures, if they could be oppoſed.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, it is part of the Nature of God to be infinitely good to all his Creatures; he therefore that loves God as ſuch, muſt needs love all that he hath made too. God's Being and Happineſs infer's that of his Creatures neceſſarily, and is the cauſe thereof, but not on the contrary: wherefore the love of God as having infinitely more excellent Effects is to be preferr'd before the love of all the Creation, if we conſider them diſtinct, and if they could be inconſiſtent one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; (which they never can be) but much more before the love of any perſon or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. And although we are ſaid not only to <hi>will</hi> but to <hi>do</hi> good to our Neighbour, and not to God; yet in truth our proper action is to <hi>will it;</hi> the outward Effect conſequent upon our will is only by God's Power and Action, and we can will it (as hath been juſt now ſaid) equally to both.</p>
                  <p>Man having naturally a great ſenſe of the infinite Excellency and Perfection of God above all muſt needs have the perſwaſion that he ought to love him above all, and that to love him is a greater Perfection than the love of all the World beſides. And the truth of it is next to the perfection of the love of all the Univerſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> God and all that he hath made together, is the Love of God di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly conſidered.</p>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:94938:140"/>
                  <p>As for the other parts of our Duty to God, (<hi>viz.</hi>) Honour, Admiration, Dependance, Obedience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they are but Inſtrumental Duties to cauſe us to practiſe Univerſal Righteouſneſs, and the great Inſtance Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Love, Love to God and to every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but they are much more excellent ones than many other, and ingenerate in us more immediately a greater and higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Holineſs (as might be particularly ſhewed) and conſequently of Univerſal Love, in which it conſiſts. Some of thoſe perſons who magnifie and commend thoſe Duties which reſpect our Neighbour, eſpecially ſuch as Beneficence, juſtice and honeſty in Dealings and Converſation, Peaceableneſs Obedience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may do well to be adviſed whether it proceeds not from ſome ſecret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to diminiſh and abate the eſteem of Piety, or of our Duties towards God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they themſelves do not underſtand the ineffable pleaſure and profit thereof when duly performed, or are leſs ſufficient and apt for them by ſpirituality of mind. They may reflect alſo and obſerve whether it comes not from ſelfiſhneſs, and that in mean and ſmall inſtances of the good things of this worldly Life. It is poſſible for men highly to commend the above-named Virtues, only that the happineſs of their preſent worldly Life might not be diſturbed, that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:94938:140"/> might attain and enjoy peace, quiet, ſome plentiful or honourable condition of Life. When it is thus, although the Virtues they praiſe are truly excellent and abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſerve it; yet there is no Virtue at all in them, nor any thing more than a mean and little Spirit, <hi>viz.</hi> ſelfiſh and worldly.</p>
                  <p>The Second thing that makes us more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the Excellency of this part of our Duty which is towards God is the unuſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it, that it is not ſo ordinary a thing. We ſee men oft-times charitable, good-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, well diſpoſed, compaſſionate, candid, juſt, veracious, and in many Inſtances hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and temperate, and that from a plain and honeſt Conſcience and general Senſe of their Duty, who notwithſtanding more rarely think of God or perform any part of the fore-named Duties to him. The principal Reaſon of which is becauſe moſt mens minds are dull and groſs, by reaſon of their bodily temper and want of Education, and cannot without difficulty perceive any thing of God, or other Spiritual matters, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding by exerciſe and uſage they may much help, God alſo aſſiſting their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.</p>
                  <p>Theſe, I ſuppoſe, may have been thoſe who have been called by ſome <hi>meer moral</hi> perſons: who, notwithſtanding, are far from being contemptible. For their defect is not
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:94938:141"/> in their will, they loving and deſiring to do their Duty univerſally to God and their Neighbour, which conſiſts in loving them: but in their underſtanding and memory, they not being ſo ſufficient and fitted to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend or retain ſuch purely ſpiritual na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as God is, and any reaſoning concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things belonging to him. They are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten much better perſons than thoſe who are more apt to apprehend, remember and talk all day of Points in Divinity or any Religious Matters, and therefore ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe them.</p>
                  <p>The greateſt part of men far (nay few are otherwiſe) are either bad or very inept for more ſpiritual Objects, and therefore uſually much neglect particular Duties to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God. Wherefore when we ſee men generally ſo negligent of their Duties to God, eſpecially in Prayer, and many living as if there were none: but take notice that we for our parts are not guilty thereof, but are careful and greatly delight to obſerve our Duty towards him, we are the more ſenſible of the excellency of it. What's rare we think it hard to be obtained, and are apt to think it Excellent.</p>
                  <p>But here we ſhall do well to have a care of Pride and a miſchievous miſtake. We muſt have a care we pleaſe not our ſelves in our ſuperiority to others, as the Phariſee did
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:94938:141"/> to the Publican. We may, if we have not a care, not ſo much pleaſe our ſelves in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done our juſt and reaſonable Duty, as in having done that which ſo few others do, which others for the moſt part do not, and therefore in our ſuperiority to others: whereas as we ſhould pleaſe our ſelves and be well ſatisfied in the diſcharge of ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a Duty, ſo we ſhould heartily wiſh all others may be able and willing to do the like; not inſult over others as the Phariſee, who thanked God he was not as the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican, for he faſted twice a Week, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he was more pleaſed that he was <hi>better</hi> than other men, than that he was <hi>good.</hi> Others falling ſhort of their Duty by neglect may make us more ſenſible of our happineſs in performing ours, becauſe a thing is beſt apprehended when compared with its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, but by no means ſhould it make us pleaſe our ſelves in being ſuperiour to them and conſequently in their being bad or negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.</p>
                  <p>Further, We muſt have a care of conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves preſently ſo dear and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God that he muſt needs grant us in particular what we will have, that he muſt do for us what we ſhall deſire, be always of our ſide. We muſt have a care we do not behave our ſelves as if we had obliged God, we for our parts worſhipping, acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:94938:142"/> honouring and loving of him, whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> others quite forget and neglect him.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, It is not all kind of Prayers that is ſo excellent a part of our Duty, but ſuch as I have formerly deſcribed; and yet men are apt for any performance of this Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (when there is little good in it, and if ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what good yet ſomewhat and much more bad) to think highly of and to be greatly pleaſed with themſelves, and that they are very dear and acceptable to God. There is nothing or no great matter in Prayer when a man prays words without underſtanding and ſenſe, or ſenſe without affection and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of Soul. or affectionately without ſenſe, not moved by the truth and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency (conceived ſo at leaſt by him) of the matter he prays, but meerly or principally by certain Words and Phraſes, with their circumſtances of vehemency or lowdneſs and ſoftneſs, gravity and acuteneſs, or the mutual mixtures of theſe which is called Accent or Tone, or by other external bodily ſigns of corporeal paſſions. There is no great matter when men pray in a formal, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal, heartleſs, ſenſeleſs Prayer; and yet men are apt to be very well ſatisfied with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to have a very good opinion of themſelves for the performance. Or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe there be in our Prayers great paſſions to things falſe or unjuſt, or that there is vain

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s bad; ſuppoſe that there be Pride, Envy, Revenge or other Inſtances of Self-love in our Prayers, and much more of them than of any thing that is good, ſuch as acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God's Attributes, and particularly of our dependence upon him by praying to him and thanking him (which are in all Prayers that are not meer words.) I ſay, Suppoſe our Prayers to be ſuch, (As I doubt hath been and is but too frequent) and then they are ſo far from being any part of our Duty, that they are, generally taken, ſins wicked and abominable things. And yet men meerly for ſome few general good things in them, not taking notice of what's bad; or if they do, yet confeſſing the iniquity of their holy things, and thinking all that is done away and pardoned in Chriſt, the good only remaining, though they have the ſame temper ſtill from whence theſe bad things ſprung, may conceit themſelves to have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed a moſt excellent part of their Duty. And this principally, becauſe it is extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, few men do ſo much, moſt men quite neglect God, take little notice of him, make any acknowledgment of him. And hence further may they believe themſelves in general very extraordinary excellent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:94938:143"/> and that without doubt they are highly in God's favour, moſt precious and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to him, <hi>his praying people,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that he will do any thing for them and for their ſakes.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Abuſes and Miſtakes I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned that they might be prevented. Be it ſure, that when a man reflects upon his having prayed to God, and is very well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied and pleaſed therewith, it be nothing but what is really good that pleaſeth him. Not, for Example, his ſingularity or ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority to other men: but the ſpirituality of his mind, and the well-diſpoſedneſs of his Soul, his true love to Goodneſs Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally, Hatred of Sin, Love and Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to God, Honour, Reverence, Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, Faith, Dependence and Truſt in Him, the actual Exerciſe of theſe, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> temper of mind from whence they proceed and to which they tend. Let him be ſure alſo that theſe things were in his praying to God, not in general highly pleaſing himſelf in having prayed when there was little of them: but indeed much more of ſuch worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs or wicked things I have above mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The being thus well aſſured of the goodneſs of our Prayers as it will in good mens minds raiſe up great delight and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, ſo alſo it <hi>ought,</hi> that we may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged ſtill to go on in the performance
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:94938:143"/> of ſo excellent a Duty whereby we ſhall ſtill be rendred better, more able and diſpoſed by being good to ſerve and pleaſe God, and to do good in the World.

                  <p>IV. PRaying procures Delight, Joy and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of Mind by God's ſpecial immediate Influence. God may no doubt in our praying to him ſome ways per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect all the Operations of our Souls. He may bring things either unknown or known be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to our minds; that is, reveal or ſuggeſt; he may cauſe us to attend to perceive and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand things more clearly and ſtrongly, that is, illuminate our minds; he may alſo excite and ſtrengthen our Love to our Duty, Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for Sin, Love to any particular Duty, Love to himſelf, Honour, Reverence, Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Addreſs and Dependence, Faith, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive and obediential Reſolution. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſurely he may excite and diffuſe through our Souls, Joy, Delight, Satisfaction from the Exerciſe of all theſe immediately, more than would otherwiſe be without this his eſpecial immediate Action or Influence.
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:94938:144"/> And that God doth do thus, the Scripture plainly affirms, and Reaſon it ſelf (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that Philoſophers have taught it) would conclude it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable<note place="margin">Xenoph. Sen. Cicero.</note> as well for other reaſons, as particularly to draw and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage us to the more frequent and vivid Exerciſe of theſe excellent Operations of our Souls, of theſe Graces in us. And 'tis this which makes that which is called <hi>Communion,</hi> or rather <hi>Union with God</hi> in Prayer compleat. For to have God the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Operations of our Souls, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect our Souls to God; and then for God again to make our Souls the Object of his Action or Influence (and the more of it, as there is in the more eſpecial and immediate influence of God, the more the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) is or may very properly be called <hi>Unio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> or Converſation of our Souls with God,</hi> and is a thing eaſily underſtood by all, but more felt by ſome men who are truly called godly and holy men. The Union between two ſpiritual ſubſtances cannot be underſtood to be any other than by the mutual intercourſe of operations, and is much more really ſo than that which is between two bodys.</p>
                  <p>And here we may eaſily underſtand that this Converſation with God is not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to Prayer, but may be referr'd to all our Lives, in any part of which we may
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:94938:144"/> direct the Operations of our Souls to him (as when we do any thing in obedience to his Commands) and he may again have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate influence upon us (as to ſuggeſt and ſtrengthen us in our Obedience) any the ways before mentioned. And the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenter and more vigorous theſe things are in man's Life, the more he may be ſaid to have <hi>Communion or Union with God</hi> in his Life, or to Converſe with God. And thus much for the Second ſort of Benefits of Praying.</p>
               </div>

                  <head>SECT. XI.</head>
                  <p>III. THe Third ſort of general good Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects or Benefits of Praying, are thoſe which are Helps and Means both of our Goodneſs and Comfort, of which I ſhall at preſent name but Two, <hi>viz.</hi> Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuality and Enlargedneſs of Soul.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Spirituality.</hi> By which I mean ſuch a temper of Soul whereby a man is apt to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend and be affected with Intellectual or Spiritual Objects, whether Abſolute as the Nature and Properties of all Spiritual Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſuch as our own Souls, Angels, God himſelf; Or Relative, as all the Relations and Habitudes of things one to another, ſuch
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:94938:145"/> as Cauſe and Effect, Contrariety, Similitude, Connexion and Repugnancy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive apprehenſion of which two laſt is called <hi>Reaſoning.</hi> It is manifeſt, That the Objects about which our minds are conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant in Prayer, are chiefly thoſe of the firſt ſort, God and his Attributes, our Souls and their ſeveral Perfections and Imperfections, as Ignorance and Knowledge, Errour and Truth, Vices and Virtues, or Sins and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now by frequent Exerciſe and Uſage of our ſelves to Prayer, theſe Objects become familiar to us, and ſuch as we readily and clearly conceive and apprehend, and which really and ſtrongly affect us: whereas thoſe men who never Pray or otherwiſe uſe their minds to them are only ſenſual and corporeal, or carnally minded, that is, ſuch who can only conceive and are affected with ſenſible things, and ſomewhat of reaſoning ſometimes dully enough too about them: but ſtrangely inept to ſpiritual things, blind and ſenſleſs in them.</p>
                  <p>But further, This Spirituality of Mind is manifeſtly a great preparation of Soul for Virtue and Goodneſs, becauſe they are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things. It fits our Souls to apprehend their Nature, to ſee their Beauty and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, the natural neceſſary Efficiency or Cauſality that is in them of the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the World, which can be diſcovered
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:94938:145"/> in no other thing: and conſequently really to approve, honour, admire and love them. Moreover the very ſame temper of Soul, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the ſubtilty and calmneſs of the Spirits, or any other cauſe, which diſpoſeth to Spirituality diſpoſeth alſo to Benignity or Love, which when it is univerſal and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial is the only Inſtance and Subject of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Goodneſs. Finally, The Pleaſure and Joy which the Soul perceives from her Converſation with Spiritual Objects is far more profound and piercing, more laſting and more frequent, being more in our own power than that from ſenſible and corporeal ones is; that which beſides Revelation, the Experience not only of virtuous and holy Souls, but even of Contemplative perſons, who have made tryal of both with equal advantages, hath always confirmed, and ſincerely declared to the reſt of the ſenſual World. The firſt of which do very heartily complain of and groan under the unhappy circumſtances of this fleſhly Life which ſo much hinders them from the enjoyment of thoſe nobler and ſweeter delights, and for that Reaſon (among others greater) full often breath out their thanks to God for the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and aſſurance of the heavenly Life here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, and their ſecret welcomes of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching time thereof; whither ſteals from
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:94938:146"/> them many a privy glance, where is fixed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a yearning look.</p>
                  <p>II. The Second good Effect or Benefit of this laſt ſort from Prayer, is an Enlarged<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Greatneſs of Soul. By which I mean that temper of Soul whereby it is ſufficient and fitted to apprehend and be affected with great Objects; to underſtand, contemplate, will, deſire, love, be pleaſed with, purſue and endeavour after them; or in one word, to converſe with them. By the greatneſs of Objects, I mean their having great good Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, or a capacity and ſufficiency, or ſome cauſality for ſuch: all which good Effects indeed are either immediately or mediately nothing but <hi>happineſs:</hi> they are either that in the end immediately, or the ſame in the means mediately. All goodneſs is either the goodneſs of the end, which is pleaſurable good, or the good of the means to obtain that end, which is profitable good; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this laſt is nothing but the firſt in the means to obtain it. So that all Good is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Happineſs. But to leave this ſmall but very important digreſſion; The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the goodneſs of Objects, or the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of which they are the cauſe, is mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured only by three things, <hi>viz.</hi> its Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Extention and Duration. Thoſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:94938:146"/> therefore are the greateſt which are or are moſt the cauſe of the moſt intenſe, the moſt univerſal or extended as to ſubjects, and the moſt during happineſs, of which there are infinite degrees; The higheſt of which is that being infinite in all perfection and happineſs which we call God, who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally or cauſally contains all things. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſeveral degrees of this good which each man minds, purſues and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth withal, is his Greatneſs, Nobleneſs, Excellency (or what words are uſual among men to expreſs the confuſed notion hereof) to be judged and eſteemed. He is the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt and greateſt ſoul of all who minds and purſues perpetually the greateſt good of the whole Univerſe in theſe three Reſpects, of Intention, Extention, Duration: that in all other things; or all other things as parts, or more generally means thereof, and therefore ſpiritual good as much as may be, being the greateſt in reſpect of its intention; univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal good, or that of the whole, as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in reſpect of extenſion, and the moſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick indeed; eternal good laſtly, as the greateſt in reſpect of duration. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, he is the meaneſt and baſeſt ſoul who minds and purſues only perſonal, ſenſible and preſent good.</p>
                  <p>It is manifeſt that in Prayer, as it is before deſcribed, the objects with which the Soul
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:94938:147"/> converſeth are of the greateſt and nobleſt ſort, and that by frequent uſage of her ſelf to ſuch converſation ſhe gets a habit thereof, ſo that ſhe doth with eaſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light ſo employ her ſelf: and if this fleſhly Life would permit her, ſhe would ſoon make it her conſtant and perpetual enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment.</p>
                  <p>Further, It is alike plain and evident how this greatneſs of Soul is the cauſe of Virtue or Goodneſs, and of Comfort or Joy. For Goodneſs, Righteouſneſs, Holineſs, Virtue (all ſignifie the ſame principal thing with ſome ſmall difference) in its greateſt degree is nothing but the ſincereſt, ſtrongeſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanteſt, habitual inclination and bent of will to the <hi>rectitude of our wills or actions,</hi> which is only to be found in having the greateſt good of the whole Univerſe, taking in God himſelf for the <hi>ultimate</hi> object or end of our wills, and renouncing and quitting that of any <hi>part,</hi> and therefore of <hi>our ſelves.</hi> It is therefore nothing but a preference of the moſt Publick and Univerſal Good before that of any part, and therefore before <hi>our own.</hi> And contrariwiſe, Vice and Sin is the preference of the good of any <hi>part,</hi> and almoſt always <hi>our own perſonal good</hi> before that of the <hi>whole,</hi> which is the moſt <hi>Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal</hi> and <hi>Publick.</hi> It is the having <hi>that</hi> the ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate object and end of all our wills, and
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:94938:147"/> neglecting or refuſing <hi>this.</hi> Holineſs and Virtue therefore are great and noble and excellent things, which tend to an infinite good: and if compared they are as much greater than Sin or Vice, as infinite Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion (if there can be any ſuch thing) is bigger than a ſingle Atome. The ſoul conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which is inclined to and aſpires after the greateſt and moſt noble objects muſt needs be ſo far prepared to have the higheſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, the ardenteſt love, the keeneſt deſire, the moſt intenſe and raviſhing joy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the moſt ſincere, generous and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Virtue; and muſt perfectly both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn and hate all Vice and Sin, as the moſt mean, baſe and ſordid thing. The ſame greatneſs or largeneſs of Soul diſpoſeth us infinitely to prefer one ſort of our own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal good, <hi>viz.</hi> the favour of God, as our moſt comprehenſive good, and particularly Eternal happineſs, which he hath promiſed as the Reward of Holineſs and Virtue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore another ſort thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Sin and Vice, at longeſt the momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany pleaſures of this preſent Life, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly to deſpiſe them in compare with the other, and conſequently to endeavour and purſue after Virtue, and to ſlight and ſcorn all Vice. It is certain, That it is nothing but Ignorance or a pityable and contemptible littleneſs and ſtingineſs of Soul in the greateſt
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:94938:148"/> Huffs of the Age, whatever they may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to generoſity, which expoſeth them to Vice and Wickedneſs, and makes them ſo eaſily to neglect or deſpiſe all the Laws and Rewards of Virtue and true Religion; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are not able to conceive things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Mud-walls of their own Cottage, or they are ſo ſtuffed and dryed with its Reeks and Smoaks as never to deſire them. Nay, when no leſs than Eternal Felicity is propoſed and profered to them, they are no more moved with it than a <hi>Bedlam</hi>-Sot is with the offer of a Kingdom; or ſometimes they laugh at it, like one of thoſe poor merry Fools and prefer their own naſty Cell before it. One would think the dulleſt Soul ſhould hardly forbear to enquire after it, and be willing it ſhould be true, or at leaſt without any prejudice againſt it, endeavour to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied whether it be ſo or no.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Nothing is more manifeſt than that the greater and nobler the objects are with which our mind converſeth, the fuller and mightier is our joy and pleaſure. Surely we cannot think that Boys have as great pleaſure in Conquering at Cob-Nutt, as a great Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain hath in ſubduing a Kingdom; or which is better, That a fond Child hath as great a joy and delight in ſaving the Life of its little Animal Play-fellow, as <hi>Abraham</hi> would have had in prevailing with God for the ſaving
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:94938:148"/> of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> from a miſerable Deſtruction, if there had been found there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in but Ten Righteous Perſons. There is infinite more difference between the things that men ordinarily entertain their thoughts and purſuits withal, and thoſe which the Soul converſeth withal in ſuch Prayers as have been before deſcribed.</p>
                  <p>And ſo I have given an account of ſome of the general Heads of the good Effects or Benefits of Praying to God, which I have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto proved by Reaſon and Teſtimony and Experience of all good men.</p>
                  <p>And now I deſire men would prove it one way more, and that is, by their own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, or elſe diſprove it. Make we tryal of it our ſelves, and that for ſome time together; for the Effects may not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently follow: take we ſome time, begin now to do it, to pray to God diſcreetly and affectionately with a holy, pure and innocent heart, in publick, private, ſecret; ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we do not grow better upon it. Pray to him heartily and aſſiduouſly in ſecret for ſtrength to mortifie any Luſt, thy Pride, thy Revenge, thy Envy, thy Wrath, thy Injuſtice, thy Covetouſneſs, thy Vain-glory, thy Uncleanneſs or Laſciviouſneſs, thy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance, and a Thouſand other Luſts which may be troubleſome and importunate to us ſo far as we are good, or to the Divine
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:94938:149"/> and Regenerate Nature within us. Pray to him for Univerſal Holineſs, Love to himſelf, Charity, Humility; Purity and Spirituality of Mind; for his forbearance, for his Pardon. Make thy report after ſome time, I fear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than a Temptation to boaſt too much of thy Succeſs. And as for the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of it, ſtep <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>metimes into thy Cloſet, or any retired place, deſire of God firſt to diſpoſe thy Mind that the Meditation and Action of thy Soul may be ſuch as may be acceptable to him, ſet thy ſelf to make Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments of his infinite Excellencies and Perfections, and the Inſtances thereof to all his Creation, and in particular to thy ſelf, in making, preſerving, providing for thee, and beſtowing upon thee the good things of thy Soul and Body; ſuch as Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, eſpecially of himſelf and thy ſelf, of thy preſent and future States and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, any Goodneſs or Virtue, that thou art not the moſt villanous and wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, devoid of all ſenſe of thy Duty, given up to all Sin and Wickedneſs, the means afforded ſtill of being yet wiſer and better, God's forbearance, forgiveneſs in caſe of Repentance, preſent Peace, Comfort, Joy in well-doing, the proviſion of Heaven and Eternal Life hereafter when thy Eyes are cloſed and thou art no more an Inhabitant of this World, thy Health, Strength plenty
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:94938:149"/> of Food, Rayment, Habitation, all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies of this Life in order to a good and happy Life here and hereafter. And not only make bare acknowledgments of theſe things: but heartily love and thank God for them, honour and admire him with all thy might and underſtanding, firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him to have been, to be now, and that he always will be thy beſt Friend, if thou be not thine own hindrance; Ask heartily God's Pardon for offending him and ſinning againſt the Eternal Laws of Righteouſneſs, drop an unfeigned Tear, breath out an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtrained Sigh, chide thy ſelf, beſeech God's Grace more than thy Life never to do ſo any more, reſolve to uſe all the inherent ſtrength thou haſt; come then and tell what thou findeſt, how thou likeſt.</p>
                  <p>Once more, When thou wouldſt have any thing, make thy Caſe known, propound it to God, beſeech him to give it thee ſo far as it is juſt only, leave thy ſelf and thy requeſt with God, becauſe he is wiſe and juſt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine and amend what is amiſs in thy ſelf, that thou mighteſt not be the cauſe why it is not juſt for God to give it thee, let us know how this reliſheth and what follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.

                  <p>Say further ſometimes, <hi>Great is the Lord and greatly to be praiſed, and his greatneſs is unſearchable: The Lord is gracious and full of compaſſion, ſlow to anger and of great Mercy. The Lord is good to all, and his tender mercies are over all his works. All thy works ſhall praiſe thee O Lord, and thy Saints ſhall bleſs thee. Oh happy is he who hath the God of</hi> Jacob <hi>for his help, whoſe hope is in Jehovah the Lord his God, who made Heaven and Earth, the See and all that therein is; He who telleth the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Stars, and calleth them all by their Names, who is of great Power and his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:94938:150"/> is infinite. Pſalms</hi> 145, 146, 147. Make we tryal, I ſay, our ſelves, ſee we things with our own eyes, confirm or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute all by our own experience. Let us not think it a thing not worthy our trouble to be ſatisfied in, for it is worthy of our greateſt pains. Either we believe all that hath been ſaid concerning theſe Excellent Uſes of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or we do not: if we do not, as I ſaid, try we our ſelves whether our Nature is not capable thereof, and God will not aſſiſt us; for this is the beſt way of proof. If we do believe it without trying, then do we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. If we do believe this to be true, and yet do not practiſe, it muſt needs be a ſign we are both bad and fooliſh, that we have no mind to be made good or better, no nor lift through lazineſs or ſlavery to be made happier; or becauſe we cannot have the comfort and pleaſure of Praying with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the profit of being engaged to be good, we'l part with that rather than be good and leave our bad Courſes or any Sin we love; in which as we are wicked, ſo we are ſuch Fools for our ſelves as if when we have a decrepit and infirm Body we ſhould be afraid it ſhould be made more ſound and ſtrong whereby we might be more uſeful to the World, and have the conſtant plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of a clear Health.

                  <p>V. THe Fifth general Head is Directions for Praying; theſe ſhall be of two ſorts.</p>
                  <p>1. To inform or remember our ſelves of the due qualifications of a Prayer, what they are.</p>
                  <p>2. To ſuggeſt ſome means to obtain theſe ſaid qualifications.</p>
                  <p>Again, The firſt ſort, or the due qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations are of two ſorts likewiſe.</p>
                  <p>1. Thoſe concerning the <hi>things</hi> contained in a Prayer.</p>
                  <p>2. Thoſe concerning the <hi>ſigns</hi> of thoſe things.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe qualifications again concerning the <hi>things</hi> contained in a Prayer are only like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of two ſorts.</p>
                  <p>1. Thoſe that appertain to the <hi>objects or ſenſe</hi> of a Prayer.</p>
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:94938:151"/>
                  <p>2. Thoſe which appertain to the <hi>Actions</hi> or (to uſe the moſt fit general Term I know) any <hi>Affections</hi> (by which I mean not only the paſſions) of Soul uſed in a Prayer, ſuch as I have before reckoned up and largely diſcourſed of: and which (briefly, only to rehearſe them) are,</p>
                  <p>1. Acknowledgment of God's excellent Attributes, his infinite Perfections, together with the affections of Soul conſequent, ſuch as Admiration, Honour, Reverence, Fear, Love, Faith, Hope or Confidence, Obediential Reſolution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Confeſſion of our Sins.</p>
                  <p>3. Profeſſion of our future Obedience, in which two are included many more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Actions, as Reflection, Comparing our Actions with our Duty, Acknowledgment or Confeſſion ſtrictly ſo called, Accuſation, Condemnation, Grief and Sorrow for Sin, Watchfulneſs againſt it, Reſolution to do ſo no more.</p>
                  <p>4. Thankfulneſs or Love to God for his Benefits to us.</p>
                  <p>5. A Propoſal, Recital, Explication of our Wants, their number, their greatneſs. As alſo of the reaſons and grounds of our deſires, of their importunateneſs, <hi>i. e.</hi> of their earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and frequency.</p>
                  <p>And then (6.) Our expreſs Petitions and Deſires.</p>

                  <p>Again, and laſtly, The due qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the ſigns uſed in ſo Praying, both of the <hi>Objects</hi> and <hi>Actions,</hi> or <hi>Operations</hi> of our Souls are,</p>
                  <p>1. Thoſe of Words or Speech, which are always uſed as ſigns of our immediate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions and actions of Soul, when we pray with others in their name, and ſo as they may joyn with us. They may alſo be uſed in ſecret Prayer for the more ſtrong and expreſs excitation in our ſelves both of ſenſe and of the operations of our Souls, Perceptions, Affections, Reſolutions. I ſay, they may where there is no worſe conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence than that is a good one (as ſeeming to be or a temptation to be vain-glorious) be uſed by us in our ſecret or retired Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. But even when we do not in our ſecret Prayers pronounce them with our Lips, yet they are in our Imagination, and we near al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſignifie by them unto our ſelves our conceit of things, or Ideas at leaſt, if not our affections.</p>
                  <p>Further, Theſe Words or Speech are ſometimes the ſigns <hi>only</hi> of things or ſenſe or Ideas in our minds, <hi>and not</hi> of any other operations of our Souls, as in Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, (ſo may it be in any other part of knowledge) where men write and ſpeak purely to teach and inform. Sometimes again, eſpecially with ſome properties belonging
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:94938:152"/> to them (as their Gravity, Acuteneſs, Lowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Lowneſs, Swiftneſs, Slowneſs, Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Inequality, Poſition and Site) they <hi>only</hi> ſignifie other operations or affections of our Souls, eſpecially our Paſſions, and not our Ideas or conceipts. But for the moſt part (both when written and pronounced) they ſignifie both together. It is very rare but that they indicate and ſignifie together with the ſenſe ſome quality or action of mind in the writer or ſpeaker: and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the Paſſions, as in ſentences of Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yea and of Truſt and Confidence and Deſire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> frequent in the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is any diſcourſe acceptable to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of men without them. For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Where are thy loving kindneſſes of old? Haſt thou forgotten to be gracious? Haſt thou caſt us off for ever?</hi> Great deſires are here ſignified as well as ſenſe. <hi>Oh that the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of</hi> Iſrael <hi>were come out of</hi> Sion. <hi>Pſalm 14. Verſe</hi> 7. Ardent and earneſt deſire is here ſignified by words and their order and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. <hi>Oh let the wickedneſs of the wicked come to an end. Pſalm 7. Verſe</hi> 9. And <hi>oh that men would praiſe the Lord for his goodneſs. Pſalm 107. Verſe</hi> 8. are the ſame. <hi>Oh how I love thy Law! Pſalm 119. Verſe</hi> 97. ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies Admiration at the greatneſs of his Love, as well as the ſenſe or thing, that he did love God's Law. Repetition of words
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:94938:153"/> ſignifies not only the ſenſe of ſuch words, but alſo ſome paſſion or ſome great degree thereof. As <hi>Pſalm 116. Verſe 16. O Lord, truly I am thy ſervant, I am thy ſervant the Son of thy Hand-maid,</hi> &amp;c. ſignifies not only the ſenſe, that the Pſalmiſt was God's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, but alſo the Paſſion of Joy that he was ſo, and of Hope becauſe he was ſo. And <hi>ſave now I beſeech thee O Lord, O Lord I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee ſend now proſperity. (Pſalm 118. Verſe</hi> 25.) Earneſtneſs and greatneſs of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire is here ſignified. So again for Example, When a man confeſſeth that he hath been or is the <hi>greateſt of Sinners,</hi> or the <hi>leaſt eſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ought not to ſignifie the ſuperlative degree as other words may ſometimes do; but only that they have been once great ſinners, and are but little good in the poſitive degree: And moreover, the great Paſſion of Grie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Many other Expreſſions in Prayers and other performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces when men are hot and affectionated may truly be ſo interpreted, though oft-times the perſons themſelves do not obſerve it, but will defend the preciſe meaning and ſenſe of the words when ſpoken without paſſion to be always true. But,</p>
                  <p>2. Theſe ſigns either of <hi>Senſe or Object<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="257" facs="tcp:94938:153"/> or of <hi>Operations</hi> or <hi>Affections</hi> of our Souls are other poſtures or geſtures of ſome parts of the body: ſuch as are thoſe of the head, as ſhaking it, which is a ſign of deſire or ſadneſs; of the whole Countenance as the parts thereof being compoſed and ſteady, <hi>i. e.</hi> which uſually ſignifies Attention, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Of the eyes particularly, whoſe lifting up uſually ſignifies deſire, thankfulneſs, appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, admiration, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Of the whole body, as ſtanding up, which may ſignifie appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, more uſually attention. The ſigns which ſignifie Approbation and Attention uſually ſignifie too Reſpect, Eſteem, Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. The lifting up the hands ordinarily ſignifies deſire. Kneeling uſually ſignifies Reverence, Reſpect, Submiſſion. Some certain poſtures of the Countenance ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie Grief and Sadneſs, ſome Joy, ſome Truſt and Confidence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for there are infinite variety. Poſtures and Geſtures may be alſo the ſigns of ſenſe too or of our meaning, as we ſee it is in dumb perſons, but thoſe to whom God hath granted the uſe of words and ſpeech very rarely uſe them for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                  <p>We begin at the firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> the due Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications of the <hi>Senſe or Objects,</hi> or the things about which our minds are conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant in Prayer. Some of which are theſe:</p>
                  <p>1. The Firſt is the truth of them. We
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:94938:154"/> are to take care that that which is capable thereof be true. All things that are the ſenſe or matter of our Prayers, beſides that which is the proper matter of Petition or Deſire may be falſe or true. The matter or objects of our deſire indeed cannot, becauſe they are all of them, as ſo conſidered, ſimple not complex things in ſuch manner as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions are, in which only there is that truth I now mean. For Example, In ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of the Divine Perfections, we muſt have a care that what we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to be in God, be really a pure perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and implies neceſſarily no imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or defect in the leaſt, and therefore that it is really in him. Thus when we make an acknowledgment of God's abſolute Power and Sovereignty of doing whatſoever he willeth and pleaſeth, we muſt have a care of thinking he can by his own intrinſick Power, or that it is in his Nature to determine himſelf contrary to the Laws of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or Univerſal Goodneſs, which is all one. As for Inſtance, That he can, or that there is any capacity in his moſt perfect Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to will all his Creatures to be miſerable, and to make them for that purpoſe; nay, or to will any number of them; nay, any one of them <hi>abſolutely</hi> and <hi>ultimately</hi> to be ſo; nay, or the leaſt evil to any of them without any further reſpect to any other
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:94938:154"/> good, but only that he pleaſeth himſelf therein; this is contrary to Reaſon and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Revelation. It is true, there is no ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour cauſe to God's Will or his active Power that makes him to be good, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains him from making any of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures unhappy or miſerable; (we ſhould be miſtaken again if we thought ſo) but we neither ought nor can conceive, if we attend to the Nature of God and Perfection, that it is poſſible ever for him to will <hi>abſolutely</hi> and <hi>ultimately</hi> the leaſt evil or miſery of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; his Will can never be ſo diſpoſed, it is not in his Nature, to will ſo cannot pleaſe him. That which I conceive the beſt diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed men mean confuſedly and are not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with when they acknowledge God's Soveraignty ſo unlimitedly, as that he can do what he will with his innocent Creatures, and either immediately though ſuch, or mediately, firſt contriving a neceſſity of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, throw them into Hell if he pleaſeth, is, that there is no ſuperiour cauſe to his own Will why he doth not ſo; which is true: not that it is poſſible for him ever ſo to will or to be pleaſed therewith: That even the <hi>due Relations of our Actions to their Objects</hi> or their <hi>Juſtice</hi> or <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> is ſomething, and therefore made by God or dependent upon his Will; for all things muſt have his Will or active Power to be the
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:94938:155"/> Cauſe: But then we cannot conceive his Nature ſuch as ever to have willed contrary, or not to have willed theſe Relations, not to have willed that which is juſt and right. There have been both of the moſt prophane and of the greateſt Religioniſts but miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken who have, I think, entertained theſe falſe and moſt miſchievous Opinions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God.</p>
                  <p>So on another hand, in the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Divine Goodneſs, men may have a conceit and acknowledge that God is ſo good that he will make all men happy, and therefore paſs over all their ſins though never ſo great and heinous, numerous and many; that he will not puniſh them nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther here nor hereafter; and this though they do not repent, and their minds and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are not changed at all, or very ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. They ſay they are ſinners, but God, they hope, will forgive them, for God is merciful, as they uſe to expreſs it. This is a very miſchievous falſhood, and implies him even not to be Univerſally good to all his Creation, not to do the greateſt good to it: for he cannot be ſo, unleſs he reſtrain ſometimes wickedneſs and ſinful miſchievous Purpoſes and Reſolutions of Will, and put a difference, as to Happineſs, between the Righteous and the Wicked ſometime and in ſome meaſure or other, according as ſeems
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:94938:155"/> beſt to his infinite Wiſdom. This alſo is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Reaſon and the expreſs revealed Will of God.</p>
                  <p>So again, Thoſe who may acknowledge the Divine Tenderneſs and peculiar Love to them and to ſome certain others, that he will not ſee any ſin in them, and will not puniſh them in the leaſt for it, but that they are peculiarly deſtined to an unconceivable Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Felicity in another World notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they live in their Sins, and are no better than others, and are very well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſo to do and be: who ſay further, that God hath provided and found out a way to excuſe them from actual obedience to his Laws, and from puniſhment in caſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant failure without any amendment: that they indeed have very corrupt hearts, but God for Chriſt's ſake will pardon all. Theſe perſons make God and Chriſt the worſt Patrons of ſin, the moſt unrighteous, the moſt partial, to bear with and pardon it in a few whom he pleaſeth, but to puniſh it in all the reſt with the greateſt ſeverity. Nothing more repugnant to Reaſon and Scripture in <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>In Confeſſion in like manner we muſt have the like care, and as near as we can ſay nothing but what we know to be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly true. Wherefore we muſt have a care that we do not confeſs that we deſerve
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:94938:156"/> puniſhment in ſuch things which are not ſins, nor that we are guilty in thoſe things which really are ſins, when we are not. Nor on the contrary perhaps excuſe our ſelves, or think our ſelves innocent or good when we are bad, think thoſe things no ſins, nay, very good actions which are bad ones. That which may often be in thoſe which are done with pretended or ſome little real zeal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſedly for the glory of God mixed with much more or other undue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſelfiſh ends and unlawful appetites. Nor muſt we acquit, ſlatter, connive at our ſelves, and think our ſelves not guilty of any ſins, and it may be thank God for it too, when we are; being either ignorant and forgetful of our ſelves, or wilfully vainly conceited. The greateſt part of the World are very preſumptuous and conceited generally of their own inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency (though they may ſometimes in words only or very ſlightly ſay they are ſinners) inſomuch that if you ſhould enquire of them what they have been or how they have lived, they'l tell you that no man can ſay any harm by them, and they know nothing amiſs they thank God by themſelves, they hardly know one ſin by themſelves or one bad action to confeſs, or they muſt ſtudy upon it or be put in mind of ſomething or other; whence they conclude themſelves very innocent, and take it for granted and
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:94938:156"/> act accordingly as if it really were ſo, and God knew as little by them as they do by themſelves; when perhaps they have rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done any good action, and they have little good in them. If they ſhould be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred of their Wrath, Revenge, Pride, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, Conceit and Diſobedience, Fraud, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, Injuſtice, Violence, Sacriledge, Luſt and Intemperance, their neglect of God and their Duty towards him, nay their averſation from, hatred or contempt of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Performances they will either deny or excuſe or juſtifie themſelves therein. Theſe are the far greateſt number.</p>
                  <p>But we may find ſome too on the other hand, who are ſo melancholy, fearful, and timorous, or angry and diſcontented with themſelves, that they are very apt to think thoſe things ſins in themſelves and to accuſe and condemn themſelves for them, which are not, but only defects of knowledge or prudence; when their principles were very right and innocent, and they uſed as much or more care ſometimes to do what they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended then they ought. Nay, ſome there may be who may think thoſe things ſins which are their material duty, or they ought in pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and wiſdom to have done. As when any perſon notwithſtanding the ſtirring or tumultuating of any Luſts reſiſted, diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, comes to the Sacrament, deſirous
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:94938:157"/> heartily to be better and ſtronger againſt them, and yet thinks he hath done amiſs in coming before his heart was better, when this was his duty. Theſe ſame <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>morous and diſcontented perſons alſo are apt to think themſelves guilty of ſome fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lts when they are not, or more then they are, and to take notice of what's bad and not what's good in themſelves. They take notice of the frequent aſſaults of their exceſſive and immoderate Appetites and Luſts, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of their being overcome, and not at all of their diſapprobation, diſlike, reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, repelling and overcoming them; the latter of which is as effectual a means of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging, preſerving and ſtrengthening us in goodneſs as the former.</p>
                  <p>So alſo men may miſtake in their Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion concerning Original Sin, if not rightly informed, as that we are guilty of <hi>Adam</hi>'s perſonal Sin, and ſo deſerve Eternal Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation therefore: whereas the utmoſt that ſeems to be taught us by Scripture, Reaſon and Experience (which indeed is a great and a ſad deal) is, that it may ſeem juſt to God, (or for the Univerſal Good) to conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute ſuch Laws of Nature, that Children by the Mediation of their Bodys from their Parents may be born with <hi>inordinate</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate</hi> appetites or inclinations, or with inclinations to ſome objects <hi>abſolutely</hi> for
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:94938:157"/> themſelves and <hi>ſtronger</hi> than that to <hi>holineſs or righteouſneſs;</hi> in which is the nature of <hi>Sin.</hi> Theſe <hi>inordinate</hi> and <hi>immoderate</hi> appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites or inclinations being by Laws of Nature from certain temper or diſpoſition of our bodys which is communicated from our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, may very well be called Original, or Birth-Sin, as it is in our Church-Articles. But all this though it be a very great Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to Children, yet cannot be ſaid to be their Puniſhment, becauſe no ſin in them is ſuppoſed to have preceded; but it is the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of their Parents and of their Firſt-Parents who have ſinned, to whom they are ſo related as to be looked upon by them and others as part of themſelves, and whom their Evil or Calamity ſeen or foreſeen real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth affect. Nay further, Theſe <hi>inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> and <hi>immoderate</hi> Appetites or habitual Luſts or evil Concupiſcences do certainly make it juſt for God to place ſuch Souls in whom they are in ſome ſuitable ſtate of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection and unhappineſs ſometime or in ſome degree or other beſt known to his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Wiſdom, if they be not removed or taken away, as ſome think they are in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants by Baptiſm. But all this ſtill is no <hi>Puniſhment</hi> to Children either for <hi>Adam</hi>'s or any other's perſonal Tranſgreſſion.</p>
                  <p>The neglect of a <hi>Judaical</hi> obſervation of the Lord's day hath been, and, I ſuppoſe, is
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:94938:158"/> ſtill amongſt ſome even very good perſon; one of the moſt frequently or zealouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed ſins: That they have ſpoke their own words and thought their own thoughts any time within the four and twenty hours; that is, as they interpet it, any words or thoughts concerning any worldly Affair (though it be hard to fix the bounds of worldly and religious) which in it ſelf might be hightly uſeful to ones ſelf and to others, and therefore lawful, nay commanded on another day: and this becauſe they look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Sabbath only tranſlated to another day by our Lord or his Apoſtles with the addition of the Commemoration of our Lord's Reſurrection. The Command concerning the Obſervation of which <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Sabbath they eſteem Moral (by which they mean that it is of perpetual obligation) except where God himſelf hath altered it, as they think he hath in reſpect of the day. In all which I think there are many miſtakes, As,</p>
                  <p>1. That the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves were forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den for the entire ſpace of twenty four hours of their Sabbath all thoughts and words, nay actions themſelves which were not the immediate worſhip of God internal or external, or very nearly relating there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. As for Actions it is not to be doubted but that firſt thoſe which might be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:94938:158"/> to make them ſpend a greater part of that time in the immediate worſhip of God with more vigour and fervency were never forbidden; and therefore thoſe which were for the beſt refreſhment of the body with food, and thoſe which were for diverſion ſometimes; which to ſome perſons might neceſſarily take up a good part of their time: ſuch as walking and talking about innocent or uſeful affairs of Life, and interpoſing theſe ſo much as might make them fitter for the commanded Worſhip of God, and that which their own prudence might add in publick, private or ſecret. Nor,</p>
                  <p>2. Is it more to be doubted that thoſe actions were never forbidden which were of greater good effect juſt at that time and in thoſe circumſtances (and many ſuch there may be which muſt be left to mens ſincere prudence) than the immediate Worſhip of God. As for Example, A Man's pulling his Neighbour's, or his own Ox or Aſs or Sheep out of a Ditch, where they would certainly periſh: (It is our Saviour's own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.) How much more to ride many miles Poſt, more than many of their Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath days Journey, to ſave a Man's Life rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to periſh by ſome Diſeaſe, or by violent aſſault of wicked Murtherers? And as for words and thoughts they had in this reſpect ſtill more liberty. For abundance of actions
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:94938:159"/> and otherwiſe very uſeful and good would be inconſiſtent with and indiſpoſe a man to the immediate Worſhip of God, the words or thoughts concerning which for a ſmall time may not; but clean contrary conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently and fitly divert or refreſh a man and be the cauſe of his better performance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. The place in <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> the 58. which hath been uſually quoted to this purpoſe is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath from doing thy pleaſure on my holy day, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This they neglected and had no regard to; and therefore they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and ſlighted thoſe things that God had on thoſe days commanded them. Thoſe words cannot mean their doing ſome things which might pleaſe themſelves: for eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> what God commanded might and ought to pleaſe them, and they were to delight them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in them. Again, The ſenſe of the
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:94938:159"/> words <hi>ſhalt honour him not doing thine own ways,</hi> &amp;c. is no other but that they ſhould in general honour God by keeping his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and preferring his Will before their own will and ways when inconſiſtent with or oppoſed thereto, and particularly by keeping his Commands whatſoever they were concerning the obſervation of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, that by the Phraſe of <hi>their own ways</hi> is meant their ſinful ways in oppoſition to God's Will and Commands is manifeſt from <hi>Iſa. 66. Verſe</hi> 3, and 4.</p>
                  <p>Another miſtake is, That ſuppoſing the <hi>Jews</hi> were commanded by God for the 24 hours of the Sabbath to abſtain from all words and thoughts which were not near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at leaſt relating to the immediate Worſhip of God, that this Command obligeth all Chriſtians. For on the contrary it is moſt certain, that no Commands given to the <hi>Jews</hi> by <hi>Moſes</hi> oblige any Chriſtians as given by him. They were particularly directed to that particular people and no other. If there be any of thoſe Commands that are enjoyned from God by Chriſt, who was the great Prophet and Meſſenger of God to all Mankind, or by Reaſon, and Natural Light, ſo that they appear in all circumſtances to have more good effects than bad ones, then indeed they oblige all men. Now the <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daical</hi> Obſervation of the Lord's day to all
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:94938:160"/> men (howſoever particular that of their Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath was) is not commanded neither by Chriſt, nor by Reaſon. There is not one word of it in the Scripture. And for Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it is not imaginable that it is poſſible for all Perſons of all tempers in all Climates and places, as the affairs of humane nature now are, to obſerve it as the <hi>Jews</hi> did; nor is it of more good effect, that it ſhould be ſo obſerved. And as for the tranſlation of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Sabbath-day from the Seventh to the Firſt Day of the Week by Chriſt or his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, it is without any ground from any Teſtimony that I remember to have heard. Nor is the Reaſon uſually given more conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, <hi>viz.</hi> the Redemption of the World by Chriſt being a greater Mercy than the Creation: For the Creation was of Millions more, and that of ever bliſsful and happy and moſt perfect Creatures, than the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption was. And indeed if the minute circumſtances with which the <hi>Jews</hi> obſerved their Sabbath be Moral, and therefore not changed by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, much more ſhould the preciſe day be ſo. Finally, it is to be affirmed, That only all thoſe Precepts in the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law are obligatory to all men at all times, which concern the end of all our wills and actions; namely the <hi>Univerſal Good,</hi> conſiſting of pleaſing God, the greateſt good of others and our own Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:94938:160"/> or moſt compleatly perfect and happy ſtate; and conſequently the ſuppreſſion of all ſelfiſh and immoderate Appetites or Luſts in us; And moreover thoſe few general Precepts of Prudence which perpetually to obſerve doth moſt obtain this our one <hi>ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate end;</hi> ſuch as the material part of the Commands againſt Idolatry, Prophaneneſs, Irreligion, Murder, Adultery Falſe-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> how many and which theſe are our own Reaſon and Prudence, if we have them not repeated in our Chriſtian Religion muſt only determine by the ſame ways they uſe in other matters.</p>
                  <p>In all that I have ſaid concerning the <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daical</hi> Obſervation of the Lord's day, I would not be thought as if I intended or deſired in the leaſt to undervalue and diſcourage the employment of our minds about ſpiritual things, and conſequently ſpirituality of Soul; that is, ſuch a temper whereby a man is apt to apprehend and be affected with ſpiritual matters. No, I would have it introduced into the World as much as humane nature is capable of. For although I do not think this employment and temper of Soul to be our abſolute and greateſt Perfection (which I doubt is a miſtake among ſome of the higheſt Religioniſts of all ſorts and parties) yet I know it to be a moſt excellent Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Univerſal Love and
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:94938:161"/> Goodneſs,</hi> in oppoſition to <hi>Selfiſhneſs.</hi> It al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays and calms all our bodily Paſſions and conſequent bad Impreſſions and Inclinations, it clears our Reaſon and Perception of all Perfection, of the Nature of God, of the Truth of Things, and conſequently of the Nature and Excellency of Virtue, and its only inſtance Univerſal Charity and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yea, and cauſeth us to be deeply af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with it, to admire and love it. It immediately diſpoſeth the Soul to a ſweet and eaſie benignity and goodneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I ſay, I would endeavour to introduce it as much ſtill as humane nature ſhall be obſerved to be capable of; that is, ſo much as will be the cauſe of moſt good among men as their natures or affairs are neceſſarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted. For it is certain, The employment of a man's mind about ſpiritual matters may be too much, ſo that it may waſt or dull ones ſpirits and conſequently render one leſs ſufficient to apprehend well and be affected with either ſpiritual or ſenſible things; it may weaken, flatten and darken our apprehenſion and conception, diminiſh and impair much all our natural parts; it may render us fearful, flattering, of too mean an opinion of our ſelves compared with others, ſuperſtitious, pieviſh, moroſe by too great an expenſe, or contracting ſome certain ill Craſis of the Spirits; in fine, very
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:94938:161"/> little and mean minded perſons, dull, afraid of, and angry with every ſmall thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond meaſure: whereas a free and diſcreet uſe of bodily pleaſures and converſe with ordinary affairs may ſecure us from thoſe Infirmities. But thus much I think the Condition of men will very well generally bear.</p>
                  <p>1. That there be ſome time ſet apart for the publick Worſhip of God to which all men, except very rarely, may reſort, which time may be once in the Week at leaſt or oftner.</p>
                  <p>2. Particularly to commemorate his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Preſervation and Adminiſtration of the whole Univerſe, and therein with all ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble affections to acknowledge his infinite Perfections diſplaied: and more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to commemorate that part of his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence or adminiſtration or direction and government of the affairs of Mankind, <hi>viz.</hi> Jeſus's coming amongſt us from him for our Redemption from a State of great Imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Wickedneſs, Miſery, by his Doctrine, Life, gracious Influence, procurement of Pardon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all this alſo with agreeable af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of Soul, for which the day of his Reſurrection by his own Power and Virtue, being the moſt wonderful thing and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to him, and therefore the great confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of his miſſion is well choſen. To
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:94938:162"/> which might be added by Chriſtians, for ought I ſee, the weekly celebration of the day of his Aſcenſion, if the affairs of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind could bear it, which was alſo a moſt magnificent and ſtrange thing though hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penning to two others before, and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily inferrs his reſurrection.</p>
                  <p>3. Upon the ſame day to Worſhip God in ſecret too more or leſs according as our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily temper and neceſſary affairs will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, which every ones ſincere prudence muſt determine. Particularly to entertain ones ſelf with ſuch actions and thoughts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the publick Worſhip as will prepare a man to perform it better, more to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend and be affected with the ſpiritual things that do occur therein, and to abſtain from thoſe things which may indiſpoſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit a man for that performance: And ſo after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to take ſome time to impreſs upon our memory, examine, inculcate upon our affections what might have occurred: and moreover to think of, contemplate, and affect our ſelves with any other ſpiritual things, as the Exiſtence, Nature, Actions of God; of our own Souls, what we were, are, ſhould be, ſhall be: our imperfections, perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for all which we are fitter by freedom from bodily action and calmneſs. This very day is alſo a very fit ſeaſon for inſtructing of Families, and performing Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:94938:162"/> and Duties of Religion with them, alſo for all acts of Charity both Spiritual and Corporal to our Neighbour. The Church of <hi>England</hi> hath in one of her Canons very piouſly deſcribed how ſhe would have holy days to be obſerved: which were it care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obeyed would be a very grave Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to her. Nor can it therefore be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for ſuch an end to encourage Plays, Paſtimes, Recreations, worldly Affairs, but barely to tolerate ſome leſſer matters which prudence might not think ſit to exact rigid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but to leave to every ones liberty. And as for times of neceſſary Diverſion or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation which uſually is accompanied with ſome folly and debauchery, others are a great deal fitter for ſuch a purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>And now if the Lord's day and other holy days were thus obſerved, there would be far more of ſpiritual employment of our minds, and more effectual for the great end of making us better than there was ever among the <hi>Jews</hi> in their ſtricteſt obſervation of their Sabbath; a great part of which was taken up in the bare external Worſhip of God, or in the external ſigns of Honour, as in the care of their beſt Apparel, and well provided Tables, their Gate, their Voice, and other ſuch unprofitable and trivial matters, as <hi>R D Kimchi</hi> obſerves upon the place in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> before quoted. What a ridiculous
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:94938:163"/> Obſervation of their Sabbath was the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining from twiſting ones Whiskers, or running a Needle twice through a Clout, or writing two Letters, becauſe theſe were <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> or Works? Of this enough every where in their Authours, and particularly in the <hi>Talmudical Tract of the Sabbath:</hi> moſt of which were only an ignorant and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious application of God's general Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, as it ſeems, of which ſome Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians have been or may be ſoon too much guilty. It may be here adviſed that there is great difference as to perſons; and that there may be ſome whoſe conſtant employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or leiſure may give them ſuch advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of ſpending much time upon other days about ſpiritual things, that it may not be ſo needful nor convenient for them to ſpend ſo much time on theſe; and that oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the principal reaſon eſpecially of their publick obſervation is the giving a good Example to thoſe who elſe would take too much liberty. But to the generality of men, if theſe fixed and ſet times be not made uſe of for the ſpiritual employment of their minds, it will be quite neglected.</p>
                  <p>But ſo much for this digreſſion, which I intended no other than only in general to ſuggeſt many things to be conſidered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this matter, not particularly to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſs them; and therefore have taken no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:94938:163"/> of what others of other perſwaſions had ſaid, or might have objected.</p>
                  <p>In like manner are they miſtaken who confeſs, That the beſt actions the beſt men do are ſins, and even deſerve eternal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (but pardoned in Chriſt) from that place in the Prophet miſunderſtood, <hi>viz. All our Righteouſneſs are as filthy rags,</hi> ſpoken of the generality of the Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were very bad, <hi>Iſaiah 64. Verſe</hi> 6. When the truth of the Caſe is, that many and many a good man have done many and many an Action in which there was no ſin, and which deſerves no puniſhment. For he who hath in any Action with the greateſt vigour of his Soul he then had, propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, intended and willed his duty, right, juſt, and that conſiſting in the moſt univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal good, the greateſt good he can know, <hi>viz.</hi> in pleaſing of God and doing the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt good to the World he at that time was capable of, and moſt perfecting and making happy himſelf in ſo being and doing; I ſay, this perſon ſeems to me to have done ſome action in which there's no ſin nor deſert of puniſhment, and I do not doubt that there hath been many ſuch an action done. It is true, Righteouſneſs and the good of the whole World, God, our Neighbour, our ſelves, and God alone deſerve to be loved
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:94938:164"/> with a greater degree of Intenſeneſs than we are capable of, even with the infinite one of God himſelf: but this is but a neceſſary Imperfection of all created Natures, even of the higheſt Angel, and would have been in the ſtate of Innocency.</p>
                  <p>In giving thanks likewiſe we muſt uſe the ſame care. For as men may confeſs ſins when they are no ſins, and when they are not guilty of them; ſo alſo they may thank God that they have received certain favours and benefits from his hands, when either they are no benefits nor inſtances of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, or if they be they have not received them. So men may thank God that they are led into ſome great truth, as they think, that they are of this or t'other perſwaſion or party, and in the right way, and now ſure to be ſaved; when their truth is ſome trifling or hurtful errour, and 'twere better for them and the World, that they were of another mind, or another way, and even of that from which it may be they may thank God they are delivered.</p>
                  <p>Thus men may alſo thank God, and be highly raviſhed with the diſtinguiſhing love of God to them in electing, juſtifying, ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, glorifying and ſaving them, and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them certainly from Eternal Miſery or Hell; when all this may be only an Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:94938:164"/> of their own cauſed by ſelf-love and ſelf-flattery, and nothing of truth in it, and really they are very bad perſons, having many and great Luſts unmortified, known even to themſelves (but yet, as they think, to be over-looked by God, becauſe they are and will be ſure they are his Elect Children) and more yet unknown, unregarded, and not taken notice of by themſelves, being, alas, oft-times very ignorant, inept, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs or partial examiners of themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Men may thank God that they are not guilty of ſome ſins, when they are, not knowing their own hearts, which is a very difficult thing; and that they have ſome graces, as ſincere Zeal, Humility, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when they have not, but inſtead thereof, or at leaſt mixed therewith Wrath, Pride, Vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory: or in general, that they have greater degrees of holineſs than they truly have, as the Phariſee did. They may thank God for owning their Cauſe by Succeſs in War or Law, when he doth not, but only chaſtiſeth it may be or correcteth another. They may alſo apply general or particular Promiſes made to other good men to themſelves, and thank God for them that he hath made ſuch Promiſes to them, when they do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain to them. And laſtly, In the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular deduction and recital of our Caſes or Conditions, or the reaſons and grounds of
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:94938:165"/> our Hopes we muſt obſerve the ſame ſtill, not aggravate nor extenuate more than is true. As a man may propoſe to God in his Prayers the great machination and malice of his Enemies, their inſulting over him, the diſhonour of God himſelf by them, if he be not delivered by him; when little of this may be true, moſt of it being only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited ſo out of Pride, to render himſelf more conſiderable, or to ſhew that he can or will deal with them all, or out of Wrath; or it is more feared than real: many other Inſtances of theſe Particulars might be given.</p>

                  <p>II. THe Second due Qualification of the Senſe of our Prayers is, that the things be Juſt. And this reſpects only that part of Prayer called Petition. When we deſire that God ſhould give or grant any poſitive or privative good thing to us, let us be as ſure as we can that it is juſt he ſhould grant it to us. Juſtice is a property of an action, and that which we <hi>immediately</hi> deſire in Prayer, is God's <hi>granting any thing to us.</hi> And here we are eſpecially to uſe Divine Revelation or God's Word rightly interpreted, and our own beſt Reaſon to
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:94938:165"/> know what is Juſt. Thus for Example we muſt not pray to God that he would grant us any thing which may gratifie our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, Envy, Ambition, Covetouſneſs, Wrath, Vain-glory, or any other Luſt: as ſometimes the ruine or deſtruction or hurt of our Enemies, indeed becauſe <hi>ours;</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity for our ſelves and ours, and ſucceſs in an unjuſt or wicked Undertaking, great Riches, Relations, Employments, Parts, and Gifts, without taking any notice of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God or doing good therewith; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that we might be ſuperiour to others, or acquire Name or Reputation, or be able to advance and propagate certain Opinions and Uſages, becauſe <hi>ours,</hi> and aboliſh or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move others, becauſe <hi>contrary to ours:</hi> in which caſe our Requeſt is not that God would grant theſe things to be done, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe good for the World and pleaſing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to himſelf, but indeed to gratifie us only, and that in hurtful miſchievous and therefore unlawful deſires. This oft-times lies at the bottom, and is the only cauſe. And though we may ſometimes ſlightly or it may be confidently judge the things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial to the World, to others as well as our ſelves, and acceptable to God, yet 'tis the gratification of thoſe unlawful deſires may make us to judge ſo. Sometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed and moſt ordinarily perhaps there is a
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:94938:166"/> mixture. St. <hi>James</hi> tells his fellow Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans that ſome of them <hi>asked and received not becauſe they asked amiſs to conſume it upon their luſts</hi> or pleaſures, thoſe (<hi>viz.</hi>) of pride and ſenſuality, <hi>James 4. Verſe 3. The Sacrifice of the wicked is abomination, how much more when he bringeth it with a wicked mind?</hi> Prov. 21. <hi>Verſe</hi> 27.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall often hear of Faſtings and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of contrary and diverſe Parties for Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory and Succeſs in any Affairs and Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings too, when both cannot be juſt. In ſuch Caſes it is a very good Petition that God would favour or proſper the juſt Cauſe. And yet this may not always ſeem good to God neither; but we ought to refer it to him as all other Petitions. Thus Sects and Parties in Religion pray with a great earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and confidence for the Converſion or Extirpation of each other, when it is ſure but one of thoſe Prayers can be juſt.</p>
                  <p>If when we Petition God for any thing we be careleſs and negligent whether it be juſt or no, and yet perhaps very confident and bold too in asking, we greatly diſhonour God. For hereby we beget an Opinion in our ſelves and others and ſuch a ſuitable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, that God is more fond of us and our concerns than of what is juſt and right, that is in effect, that he loves us in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar better than all the World beſides, as if
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:94938:166"/> he muſt needs do what we deſire him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be right or wrong. But if we do at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to and examine with as much care as we ought before we pray whether what we pray be juſt and fit for God to give, and do without any prejudice from ſelf-love con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it may be ſo, and yet ſhould be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; this is only a defect of our knowledge, the ill conſequence of which is ſoon amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by referring all our Petitions to the unerring Wiſdom of God, of which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                  <p>But we may through undue ſelf-love ſo flatter our ſelves and think our ſelves ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable and dear to God that we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit it cannot but be juſt for him to do what eſpecially we with great earneſtneſs and zeal (as if he were the inſpirer of it and put it into our hearts, when it is it may be our own Pride or other ſelf-love) Petition him to do. More modeſty better becomes us, whereby we may have a true and due judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our ſelves. And when we have that and do with good reaſon think our ſelves ſo far good only as we really are, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently in the favour of God; yet we are to be ſo modeſt too as to remember that we can but very rarely certainly tell in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars with all their circumſtances what is abſolutely beſt for the World, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently what is juſt for him to do. He who
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:94938:167"/> is All-comprehending in his knowledge al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways certainly knows, and to him therefore we refer the Juſtice, and conſequently the granting of our deſires. The confidence of ſome perſons in their Prayers proceeding from Ignorance and Pride when their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers have been heated eſpecially, how blameable, how hateful and contemptible?</p>
                  <p>The wiſer ſort of <hi>Heathens</hi> had ſo good an opinion of their Deities, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of their Duty towards them that they would be ſure to ask nothing from them but what was juſt. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>III. THe Third due Qualification of the Senſe of our Prayers is, That they be in the firſt place and moſtly of the greateſt importance and concernment.

And this concerns all the parts or Ingredients of a Prayer. As in Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment let us be careful to be well inſtructed in the greateſt, the moſt compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive and general, the moſt uſeful and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial Perfections i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> God, that we make our Acknowledgments of thoſe principally and chiefly; as that of his infinite and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral goodneſs to all more than his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular goodneſs to us. And ſo when we make an Acknowledgment of the Inſtances of his Power, Wiſdom, Goodneſs, Mercy, Juſtice, let us take thoſe chiefly which are the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and largeſt, and endeavour to be affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with them; ſuch as are God's Creation of all things, Preſervation, Providence throughout the whole Univerſe, that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Mankind, and eſpecially the making of us Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſonable Creatures and giving us ſuch Faculties, Aid, Sufficiency, Opportunities, Helps to improve our Reaſon and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: alſo the Revelation of ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Doctrines and Truths to the World by eſpecial Meſſengers the Prophets of old, and laſtly by Jeſus Chriſt his beloved Son.</p>
                  <p>In Confeſſion let us take notice of and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail moſt our greateſt Sins, that have moſt of Iniquity in them, where there is the greateſt degree of the depravedneſs Inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:94938:168"/> of our Wills included, the greateſt Averſation from Righteouſneſs, the greateſt degree of unreaſonable and miſchievous Self-love; in a uſual Phraſe, our <hi>moſt ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated Sins.</hi> Conſequently let us confeſs our deareſt, moſt pleaſing and delightful ſins: for our greater degree of delight in any thing more than in our Duty, argues a degree of the inordinacy and depravedneſs of our wills as to Intenſeneſs: thoſe alſo which are moſt frequent.</p>
                  <p>Contrariwiſe let us not confeſs little ſins much, and neglect great ones, or more than thoſe; confeſs thoſe which we can more eaſily forſake, and neglect thoſe which are moſt ſweet, paſs over them or ſlightly only take notice of them; confeſs thoſe which we commit rarely, and neglect thoſe which we do frequently. When this fault is in our Confeſſion purely through ignorance, through want of underſtanding of the degrees of ſin, and there is no fault in the will, which I ſcarce believe, it begets in us a great deal of ſuperſtition, that is, an opinion that ſome actions are more or leſs diſpleaſing to God than indeed they are compared with others; and conſequently being more afraid of doing ſome of them and of God's anger or puniſhment for them than we ſhould be, and in others again leſs: which is a very bad effect and doth much deprave and corrupt
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:94938:168"/> the Inclinations of the will as to the Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of our duty, and renders us leſs capable of any happy condition till we are better inſtructed in them, though we ſhould be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſcientious and love that which we judge right and our duty: which poſſibly may be. But I am apt to think that moſt ignorant ſuperſtition proceeds from uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiouſneſs. But when this fault pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds out of a deſire to indulge our ſelves in ſome ſin, both the Cauſe and the Effect is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely bad.</p>
                  <p>If we have occaſion to confeſs National Sins or thoſe which are moſt practiſed fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently by the generality of a Nation, have we a care to confeſs thoſe principally and moſt which are indeed the greateſt both as to the Principle and the Effect; thoſe that argue and include the greateſt degree and neglect of, and averſation from our duty, and the great inſtance thereof compared with other objects; or the greateſt degree of <hi>ultimate</hi> ſelf-love compared with or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the common good, and thoſe which are the moſt miſchievous or do the greateſt hurt in the World. Such as are ſome the more colourable and undiſcerned ſins of Malice, Pride, Envy, Ambition, Affectation of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority, Equality, Liberty: add Tyranny, Diſobedience, Revenge, Oppreſſion, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, Fraud, Hypocriſei or want of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity;
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:94938:169"/> and others more notorious, of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs, Irreligion, Atheiſm, Unbelief, Disbelief of Chriſtian Religion, Senſuality, Laſciviouſneſs, Intemperance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thoſe Sins alſo which are the moſt frequent and continual in ſeveral or the ſame perſons are to be principally confeſſed.</p>
                  <p>In thankfulneſs likewiſe it is much to be attended to, and we ought to give thanks in the firſt place, and moſt frequently and moſt ardently for the greateſt favours, thoſe that are moſt publick diffuſed and general, thoſe that are ſpiritual or intellectual, thoſe that appertain more immediately to the Soul, thoſe among ſpiritual ones which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern our wills or inclinations, and in order thereto our affections, called generally by the names of Sancti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ication or Regeneration, purifying and renewing of the heart, or in one word uſually by the name of <hi>Grace;</hi> then afterwards for the good things that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain to our Knowledge or Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, as quick and plentiful Suggeſtion, Revelation, Illumination in Truths of the greateſt Excellency, Uſe and good Effect; for ability to ſignifie, convey or propagate theſe, ſuch as ready Invention, Memory, Utterance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which have been known by the name of <hi>Gifts;</hi> Then for the good things appertaining to the Body or in it as the ſubject, as Strength, Health, Comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:94938:169"/> plenty of ſuch things (as Food and Diet, Raiment, Habitations with their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) which gratifie our Senſes, and ſecure us from Corporeal Pain which the moſt neceſſarily affects us, and conſequently from neceſſary care and ſolicitude to prevent it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then for the External good things without us, of Riches, Reputation, Liberty, Magiſtracy, Friends, Relations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Reaſon of all this is, becauſe to thank God more for perſonal than publick benefits, as it doth uſually proceed from, ſo it will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe a <hi>particular and ſelfiſh</hi> ſpirit. To thank him more for bodily or external ſenſible good things than for ſpiritual is both a ſign and cauſe of ſenſuality in us, <hi>i. e.</hi> it doth proceed from and confirm our exceſſive love to corporeal and ſenſible good in compare with ſpiritual, as well as keep us in ſome reſpect to God. It is that which may be ordinarily obſerved, <hi>viz.</hi> that men are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally much more ſenſible of and grateful to God for bodily good and the things of this life, than for ſpirtual or intellectual.</p>
                  <p>And ſo likewiſe to thank God more for Gifts than Graces, though both ſpiritual things, confirms one in too great an eſteem and love for Gifts compared with Graces, which notwithſtanding are incomparably inferiour to them. Gifts ſometimes may be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ill uſed, be miſchievous and hurtful, which
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:94938:170"/> ſincere Virtue and Grace can never in the leaſt be. Knowledge puffeth up without Charity, and is contentious, affecting, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuous: but Charity edifieth, ſaith the Apoſtle. Charity even without Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge can do no harm, but in its own nature neceſſarily tends to do good. Now although this be better than not to be thankful to God at all, than to thank him neither for bodily nor mental favours; yet it is at leaſt of far leſs good effect than to be thankful for better things more and firſt, as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve. We are to thank God for every thing as neer as we can, according to its propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of goodneſs, <hi>viz.</hi> in ſuch proportion as it is a part of or means to the laſt end, the <hi>Univerſal Happineſs.</hi> And becauſe, for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, all ſpiritual good things are generally much more ſo than bodily, we muſt be oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and more ſenſibe of them, more frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and fervently thank God for them.</p>
                  <p>What hath been ſaid about thankfulneſs may be adviſed concerning Petition, that we deſire in the firſt place, principally, moſt frequently and moſt ardently the moſt uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal or publick and ſpiritual good things, ſuch as Graces and Virtues, and then all the reſt or any of them according unto their true degree of goodneſs too.</p>
                  <p>We ſee men generally faulty in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and they'l pray infinitely more hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:94938:170"/> for fair Weather or Rain when it is much wanted than for the moſt excellent and higheſt degree of any Graces or Virtues. Nay, if they dared, they would (and they really have more mind to it) pray againſt thoſe that they might not be diſturbed by them. They would ſooner pray for the Food and Pamper of their Bodys than for that which might increaſe Graces and Gifts in their Souls; more that they might have earthly Friends, who might love and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour them, than the friendſhip or favour of God; more that any man who can poſſibly puniſh them for any miſdemeanour would forgive them, than that God would; more that they may be rich, than honeſt or juſt or charitable, or make good uſe of riches, like faithful Servants and Stewards of our great Maſter God. From which ſame temper it comes that all ſpiritual benefits and favours of good Inſtruction, Exhortation, Example, and the perſons who are the Authors and Inſtruments thereof are generally leſs prized and eſteemed than a ſmall piece of Bre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d or Money, than the leaſt good appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Body or Eſtate, and their reward would be anſwerable if it were not for Laws or the Sentiments of a few of the wiſeſt and beſt.</p>
                  <p>So, Laſtly, our Explication of our Caſe may be too tedious, we may too operoſely
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:94938:171"/> aggravate our Caſe, more comparatively with other matters we even then want than we ought.</p>
                  <p>This of Petition is according to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's own Advice in that excellent Sermon; after he had warned them againſt diſtruſt, ſolicitude and over-eager care concerning worldly goods of meat and drink and cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he adds, <hi>But ſeek ye firſt the Kingdom of God and its righteouſneſs</hi> (that is, probably, God's Kingdom by Chriſt, to be the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects thereof, or to be true Chriſtians) <hi>and all theſe things ſhall be added unto you.</hi> Some ſpiritual good things, <hi>viz.</hi> Goodneſs and Virtue render us capable of all other, and fit us for the enjoyment and uſe of them; but not on the contrary. <hi>Matt. 6. Verſe</hi> 33.</p>
                  <p>This is a thing ſo obivous, that it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended and adviſed by ſome of the <hi>Heathens</hi> in their Addreſſes to their Gods. Their praying for long Life, Glory, Beauty, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, Poſterity, and other things which the Vulgar uſed to ask of their Gods the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyriſt derides as folly; becauſe they were hardly to be accounted in the number of good things, as having as much evil and miſchief attending them: But he adviſeth they ſhould rather pray for a good mind, couragious, fearleſs of death, nay, deſirous of it, patient, Maſter of Paſſions, deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer of ſelfiſh ſenſual Pleaſures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:94938:171"/> were the things principally to be ſacrificed for.</p>

                  <p>IV. A Fourth due Qualification of the Senſe of our Prayers or of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, is that it be as extenſive as may be. This alſo appertains to all the parts of a Prayer.</p>
                  <p>That our Acknowledgments, for Example,</p>
                  <p>1. Be as comprehenſive as may be and general, ſo as to comprehend all God's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:94938:172"/> which are uſeful to Petition, and ſuch are his always infinite (as to Intenſion, Extenſion and Duration,) Power, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Goodneſs: for theſe certainly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend all.</p>
                  <p>2. That they be in ſome Prayers more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, which particulars are to be (for all can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be) either thoſe that are of greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern or Importance, or which we beſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, or are moſt affected with, or which are moſt proper to any Petitions we may make. As for Example, Sometimes we may make our acknowledgment not only of God's goodneſs in general, but alſo of ſome particular inſtances of it, ſuch as his forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of us ſo long notwithſtanding our careleſs or contemptuous violations of any of his moſt righteous and holy Laws, his forgiveneſs of this or that particular ſin, of all our Sin, upon our ſincere repentance; his promiſing to us, and beſtowing upon us any particular good things, as ſuch a good advantage of Condition for Inſtruction or Virtue, ſuch an Aſſiſtance for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and performance of any particular Virtue and Duty, or againſt any Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the means of Grace, as is uſually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed; ſuch a Deliverance from ſuch a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual or corporeal Evil, &amp;c. The ſame which is to be done in our Thankfulneſs and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly loving God for his Benefits.</p>
                  <pb n="295" facs="tcp:94938:172"/>
                  <p>So our Petitions, (<hi>1ſt.</hi>) Let them be as general as may be and comprehenſive. It is convenient in Prayer always at leaſt to premiſe ſuch general Petitions before parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ones, and ſometimes for want of Time or Knowledge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they may be only uſed. For Example, That God would beſtow upon us all good things that he thinks ſit and juſt. As it is ſaid of <hi>Socrates,</hi> that he uſed when he prayed to pray only (if he always did ſo he m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ght have done better ſometimes to have propounded and deſired things more particularly and as well referred them to God) that the Gods who knew beſt what was good would give him good things. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>,<note place="margin">Xenoph. in memor. Lib. 1.</note> as <hi>Xenophon</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports. And ſomewhat more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly that he would provide for us all good things of our Souls, Bodys, Eſtates, which compr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hend all as to their ſubjects; or all here and hereafter, which comprehend all as to time; or to deſcend further, Knowledge and Goodneſs, Gifts and Graces, which comprehend all as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to our Souls; more particular yet, that he would give us to live godlily, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and ſoberly, which comprehends all Grace or Virtues, all our Dutys towards God, our Neighbour and our Selves. Such
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:94938:173"/> alſo are the Petitions in the Lord's Prayer.</p>
                  <p>But then (<hi>2ly.</hi>) after theſe general Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as oft as we have opportunity, let there be others as particular as may be, eſpecially in things of the greateſt Importance and ſometimes in leſſer Matters, according to the degree of their Importance to us, and of our apprehending them, and being affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with them. For the moſt part we bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter apprehend and are more affected with particular things than with generals. Thus let us pray ſometimes for particular Virtues or Graces, Parts or Gifts, bodily or exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal good things: ſometimes for many and a great number together. At one time we may longer inſiſt upon ſome one or a few only, at another time upon others, much according to our Need and Wants, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently alſo the Importance of the thing to us, according to our apprehending our want thereof, and being affected therewith. And in order hereunto Men ſhould make reflection upon their ſpiritual and corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Condition, ſee what they want and what they have, and accordingly direct their Endeavours and their Prayers. They ſhould obſerve whether they want any Grace or Virtue, or ſtrength againſt any Sin or Luſt, or any other eſpecially more uſeful thing, and remember the next time to propound it, and beſeech it of God more earneſtly and
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:94938:173"/> ſolemnly, as they may then and at other times with frequent ejaculatory Prayers. Men are commonly here more careleſs of their Relation to God than they might or ſhould be. Every thing which they ought to take any care to obtain, they ought alſo to ask God's Favour in it. For whatſoever we our ſelves can already do, our whole power and ability, both to will and to do, is from God and perpetually dependent upon his will and pleaſure: which he can increaſe in us as much as he pleaſeth, as he can do all things for us without making any uſe of us.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> commands it, <hi>Philip. 4. Verſe</hi> 6. ſaying, <hi>in every thing by Prayer and Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with Thankſgiving, let your Requeſt be made known unto God.</hi> And the <hi>Heathens</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in any conſiderable affair of Life, nay, the Vulgar in the ſmall and trifling uſed to invoke, or by ſome Rite to apply themſelves to ſome of their greater or leſſer Deitys.</p>
                  <p>Again, Let our Petitions be as extenſive as may be in reſpect of Perſons too; even to all who want any thing that we can and ought to deſire for them; we are not to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="300" facs="tcp:94938:175"/> Motions and Actions of Soul ſo often men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, or the degrees thereof which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſignified by them. When thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveſt or uttereſt words, know what thou ſayeſt, Attend to what is or may be beſt ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified thereby, as much as thou canſt. Talk not like a Parrot, or rather like young Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren at School, when they ſay their Leſſons. When thy Voice is vehement or loud, let it not be meerly cuſtomary, or becauſe thou affecteſt it only for ſome undue end; for ſome undue end, I ſay, nor, it may be, to quicken thy Invention or Memory, or clear thy Conception, or becauſe being aſſured of the goodneſs of any thing, thou on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe exciteſt and uſeſt the help of thy cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal Paſſions to affect or determine thy Soul; all which ſometimes are and may appear to others with approbation to be no unfit reaſons. Let thy affection in thy own heart, and a great deſire to convey it and to excite it more in others or thy ſelf, or thy great Admiration of the Excellency of the thing, or whatever paſſion or operation of Soul in any degree is properly and fitly ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by thy vehemency of Voice, go before it, and be really inherent in thy Soul, and be the cauſe from whence it proceeds. If thou compoſeſt thy countenance, or takeſt thy ſenſes from other objects, let there really be great and ſerious attention. If thou
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:94938:175"/> lifteſt up thy eyes or hands, let it proceed from inward deſire, Addreſs to God, and Approbation. If thou bendeſt thy Knee or Body, or erecteſt it by ſtanding up, let there be truly and really theſe things in thy Soul. Although I know too that many of theſe Signs are not ſo neceſſarily proper to theſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ffections and actions of Soul, but that they may alſo be done from, and ſometimes ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie no more in ſome circumſtances than unwillingneſs to give a needleſs offence, and a certain Chriſtian Humanity and Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Nay not only words and geſtures of Body are to be true Signs of inward Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Soul, but alſo ſome Actions or Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of Soul truly ſignified are much ſigns again of others. Thus great Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Paſſions for things in men eſpecially who ſtudy, and are ſuppoſed to conſider and examine, whoſe buſineſs it much is or ſhould be, are ſigns to the generality of people of their clear underſtanding of the certain truth and excellent uſefulneſs of them. And this together with a pretended or real great love to the Souls of men (which is indeed a truly generous and divine temper) have been ſome of the cauſes that ſome men have had ſo many followers and admirers, and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hath been ſaid by them hath been believed to be as true and excellent as the Word of God it ſelf, without any ſcruple.
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:94938:176"/> When therefore our Affections are great and ſtrong, let there be alſo preceding an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and conviction of the truth and uſefulneſs of things, either from our own ſight and perception, if we can, or from Divine Teſtimony, or (which is moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, eaſie and much ſafe) from the moſt general Teſtimony of the wiſeſt and beſt men. Let not our great Paſſions be only an affected buſsle to make people believe we are in earneſt for ſome great matters which we have diſcovered.</p>
                  <p>2. By ſincerity in theſe Actions in Prayer, I mean, that they all or thy whole Prayer have their <hi>due Ultimate end</hi> unmixed with any other. Let thy Ultimate End in general be ſincerely to do thy Duty, that which thou judgeſt thou oughteſt, and to be more diſpoſed to be univerſally, conſtantly, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiouſly good and virtuous, to love and pleaſe God, to be the moſt beneficial to the World, and to perfect and make happy thy ſelf by poſſeſſing thy Soul with the Graces of a moſt univerſal, conſtant and generous Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that in the beſt Inſtances, <hi>viz.</hi> in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things as much as thou canſt, and in all others when they may be fitteſt or the only Inſtances thou canſt then perhaps be charitable in; of ſelf-denyal, humility, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituality, by the mortification of all <hi>inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy</hi> and <hi>immoderacy</hi> of thy Appetites, of all
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:94938:176"/> Luſts; by being ſober; adviſed, diſcreet, and wiſe, and by the uſe of all other good things we are capable of receiving, poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, enjoying from God: Let theſe things, I ſay, be purely and ſincerely thy <hi>Ultimate End.</hi> If thou acknowledgeſt God's Infinite Perfections, let it be to produce in thee ſome way or other (as it will) Obedience and Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and conſequently Univerſal Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Holineſs and all the Inſtances thereof now mentioned.</p>
                  <p>If thou confeſſeſt thy Sins, let it be to excite and ſtir up, whet and ſharpen thy hatred againſt all Sin; and when thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeſt thy obediential Reſolution, let it be to confirm, ſtrengthen and invigorate thy love and liking, reſolution and bent of Soul to all Obedience, and to thy Duty univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally.</p>
                  <p>When thou thankeſt God ingenuouſly for his great kindneſs and love, for his benefits to thee, let it be ſincerely to engage thee to love him again; conſequently to imitate, obey, pleaſe him, and conſequently to be univerſally holy and righteous. When thou propoundeſt or reciteſt thy Caſe or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, or that of any others for whom thou prayeſt, let it be ſincerely to cauſe thy ſelf ſome way to be better, by cauſing thee more to attend to thy dependence upon God and to be more ſenſible thereof, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:94938:177"/> to behave thy ſelf ſo as to pleaſe him.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, When thou deſireſt or peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneſt any thing, let thy <hi>Ultimate end</hi> be ſtill the ſame; quicken thy acknowledgment and ſenſe of thy entire dependence upon God by which thou may'ſt be engaged to love and pleaſe him, which cannot be without holineſs Univerſal. Moſt expreſly Petition God for his Grace and Aſſiſtance to make thee the moſt perfectly holy and righteous thou art capable of, in ſuch manner and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances as is aforeſaid, truſting in God he will grant thoſe thy Petitions (then which none are more acceptable to him) and uſing the utmoſt of thy endeavours in complyance with his ſupervenient help. Finally, When thou beſeecheſt God for all or any other good things, let it be that thou may'ſt be diſpoſed and enabled thereby to ſerve him and the world, to live profitably and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably here, and at laſt to obtain an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal and everlaſting reward. Theſe things, I ſay again, are to be purely, ſincerely and unmixedly the <hi>Ultimate end</hi> of thy Praying in general, and of all the parts thereof. Let no other thing come in the place hereof or mix and blend therewith. Let not, for Example, meer dull Cuſtom be the end; that is, meer pleaſing a man's ſelf with ſo doing, and eſpecially the external or bodily
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:94938:177"/> part, becauſe a man hath uſed ſo to do, he will ſo do. Not the meer Action or Uſage ſo much as the good effect of it is to pleaſe, ſuch as the name of our Duty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes and ſuppoſes. We muſt not pray as aged men in part uſe old faſhions, or ſome other little actions, as walking, eating, drinking at certain times, <hi>viz.</hi> principally becauſe they have been uſed ſo to do; it is eaſie, it is delightful meerly to do ſo, and it would be painful and troubleſome to them to abſtain or to live after any other manner. Let not again the procuring a great Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of us for Sanctity, for Conſcienſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Honeſty, Spirituality, for great Parts or Gifts, for Readineſs, Copiouſneſs, variety of Invention, Memory, Judgment both in Things and Words, Senſe and Phraſe, for the uſefulneſs and general goodneſs alſo of both, that we can Pray much, or are well furniſhed with Matter, that we can Pray long and often, or are very frequent in Prayer, that we are good Church-men, that we never miſs Prayers, that we can Pray with an acceptable and pleaſing Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very or Voice; let not this vain glory of Praying long and frequently in every place, in Synagogues, corners of Streets, repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Chriſt in the Hypocrites of his Age, <hi>Matt.</hi> 6. I ſay, let not this be the End. Again, more Univerſally, Let not the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:94938:178"/> of any Luſt, as Senſuality, Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Eaſe and Sloth, Malice, Ill-will, Pride, Affectation of Superiority, Equality or Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, Revenge, Envy, Ambition, Vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory, Covetouſneſs; not the Procurement of ſome Advantage for Employment, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerment, Rule, Gain, Trade, or the like, in the leaſt peep in and mix with the noble end before mentioned. Let not, laſtly, even the pleaſure, ſatisfaction and delight we may find in all the Operations of our Souls in Prayer, ſuch as clear perception and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of God, his Attributes, of things ſpiritual, future, ſublime, and of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, eſpecially our being affected with them; not the pleaſure of our both great and good Paſſions, as Admiration, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Love, Joy, Faith and Truth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though rightly and duly excited according to the true goodneſs of things underſtood, uſually ſignified by the names of <hi>Tranſports, Raviſhments, Extaſies,</hi> I ſay, let not even this be our <hi>Ultimate end;</hi> but rather one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding little, and very inconſiderable part thereof; the other of being bent and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to pleaſe God by doing all good, being infinitely more valuable, as tending to an infinitely greater good. Notwithſtanding let us maintain and cheriſh this our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and ſatisfaction all we can poſſibly in a thing ſo rightly directed, and ſo truly
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:94938:178"/> uſeful to pleaſe God and ſerve the World, and thank God we are ſo tempered as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſo much therefrom. And theſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being but perſonal and proper Goods muſt not either in this nor any other action be placed in the room of our <hi>Ultimate end</hi> ſo often named, nor be admitted to any mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or co-ordinacy with it, but as Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or little parts thereof. The pleaſing God and doing the greateſt good to all others, and our own Salvation (that is, our own greateſt Perfection and Happineſs) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered all together as one good thing is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely the nobleſt and moſt perfect end of our Actions we can have, and is the ſame which God himſelf always hath. But any other end beſides this (which almoſt always is ſome perſonal good where the other is not) is comparatively mean, ignoble, ſordid, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible.</p>
                  <p>All the <hi>Pſalms</hi> are Inſtances and Examples of this ſincerity as well as fervency and other qualifications to follow as much as can be conjectured by Words written (and feignedneſs and hypocriſie and bie, and bad reſpects would ſomewhat betray themſelves) as <hi>Pſalm 17. Verſe 1. Hear the right, O Lord, attend unto my cry, give ear unto my Prayer that goeth not out of feigned lips;</hi> or as in the Margin, <hi>without lips of deceit.</hi> The moſt likely ſenſe is, that <hi>David</hi> had no other end
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:94938:179"/> in his Prayer to God, but that God ſhould favour that which was right, that he ſhould beſtow that which was juſt upon him. And <hi>Pſalm 66. Verſe 18. If I regard Iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me.</hi> It a man have an habitual love to, and approbation of any wickedneſs, it is the moſt likely way to, and moſt generally it would, hinder the granting his Prayer; nor can a man ſee any ſufficient reaſon to expect any ſuch thing, if he be conſcious to himſelf of regarding any Iniquity with allowance. But much leſs ſure could <hi>David</hi> think his Prayer ſhould be heard, if he were conſcious to himſelf that he was guilty of inſincerity or that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Iniquity of having any unlawful end even in his Prayer it ſelf, as to gratifie Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, Pride, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is true, It might ſeem in ſome places as if ſome of his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers proceeded from Revenge, as eſpecially <hi>Pſalm 69. Verſe</hi> 22. After he had complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the cruelty of his Enemies, he prays <hi>that their table might become aſnare before them,</hi> and as for <hi>their good things,</hi> or their peaces <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> (for the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſignified all good by the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> or peace) let them be a trap, that is, let even their good things miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieve them, or prove evil to them. <hi>Let their eyes be darkened that they ſee not,</hi> &amp;c. But ſurely firſt <hi>David</hi> ſuppoſeth them to be villanous and wicked, unjuſt, proud, cruel
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:94938:179"/> men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that they were all other milder ways incorrigible. And then certainly it is equally lawful to pray for their puniſhment, or to wiſh it, as to inflict it; which a man might and ought, if he had lawful Power. And this a man might do even in his own Caſe, not out of Revenge in the leaſt, but out of hearty love to the publick good, by encouraging, reſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>uing and defending Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and Virtue, and by reſtraining and ſupreſſing Wickedneſs and Injuſtice. I do not think but that <hi>David</hi> would willingly have had his Enemies changed their minds and repented, not meerly becauſe his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but becauſe unjuſt and conſequently Enemies to God and Men, or hurtful to the World. But if it appeared they would not do that after long forbearance, there might be reaſon to judge it moſt juſt, and conſequently pray to God, that they might be puniſhed. <hi>David</hi> alſo is found ſomewhere praying for his Enemies (it may be till they were incorrigible but by puniſhment) <hi>Pſ. 35.

                  <p>II. THe Second due Qualification of our Actions or Operations of Soul in Prayer, is, That they be intenſe and ſervent in ſuch proportion as they ought, eſpecially conſidered comparatively with the ſame Operations about other Objects. Thus in acknowledgment of the Divine Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Attributes, let us apply our minds thereto and be attentive. And ſo likewiſe in our Confeſſion, Profeſſion, Thankfulneſs, Explication, Petition; cauſe we our minds to attend to the objects thereof with all the vigour and ſtrength they ought, ſo as that they might not be too eaſily drawn off by other Objects that may either preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to our Senſes, or make an attempt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Imagination; our Thoughts are not to be too ſlight, wavering, wandring, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, unconſtant, ſo as to be ſometimes more ſmartly upon other matters of more triſling concerment, our ordinary, daily and ſmall Affairs, or, it may be, upon our Sins and Luſts when we are performing this Duty, we caſting only a ſhort and weak glance upon the things we are about. Our hearts and minds ought to be much, and as much as it is poſſible, upon ſuch excellent
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:94938:180"/> and uſeful things as are or ſhould be in our Prayers. We ſee with what application and attention of mind we do all other things of far leſs concernment; and in particular, if we are to make any addreſs to any perſon of Dignity and Authority and real worth, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to thank him for, or deſire from him any one and no great favour.</p>
                  <p>So for our Admiration, Honour, Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, Fear, Love, Faith, Hope, Joy, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, Reſolution of Obedience, be they in that meaſure and proportion of Life, Vigour and Strength they ought, and certainly that cannot be too much; for the Objects of all thoſe in God are infinite. In Confeſſion, let our grief for Sin in general or Sins in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and hatred of them be inward, pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, great, laſting according to the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievouſneſs of Sin above other Evils, which is almoſt without compare, and according to the degree of Iniquity and pravity in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sin. Our Reſolution in the Profeſſion of our Obedience let it be firm and ſtrong. Our Thankfulneſs and Love to God for his particular Goodneſs and Benefits towards us, or to any other for the Inſtances of his general Goodneſs to all; as alſo our Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Deſires let them be hearty, ſtrong, vigorous, according to the goodneſs and value of the things received or deſired.</p>
                  <p>It really is an unreaſonable and unjuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:94938:181"/> thing that men ſhould have all theſe Paſſions and Actions, all theſe Operations o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Soul in the firceſt and intenſeſt degree about other ſmall inconſiderable, trifling objects in other affairs of Life, and yet here to be almoſt meer Hypocrites, to have little of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Action and Life; which ſometimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trays it ſelf even by bodily dulneſs, ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſhneſs, ſleepineſs, Oſcitancy not cauſed by length or any meanneſs of the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but when it is done ſhort enough and well, and by mens own ſelves too: Or if they be a little buſie in external and bodily actions with their mouths or other parts of their body; yet the internal actions of their Souls, ſuch as I have above mentioned, are very ſlight, weak and ſlender. Perſons ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to God with their Lips and their Bodys when their Hearts are far from him, and, it may be, after their Covetouſneſs, or any other Luſts. Or they are there with him and converſant about him and other matter of their Prayers, as men uſe to be in the company of thoſe perſons, and in doing thoſe things they do not much care for, or have no great value for. It is really a thing of which men are to be aſhamed, that they are converſant about leſſer matters with great attention and affection, and about in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely greater ſuch as are in this part of the Worſhip of God with little or none: it is
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:94938:181"/> certainly a ſign of their pitiful ignorance and errour, degeneracy, baſeneſs and meanneſs; that they are like Children and School-boys who are attentive and eager about their Sports and Paſtimes, but not at all concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Cares of their Parents for them and the reſt of their Families. Is it not a ſhame to ſee men honour and admire mortal men, a potent Prince, a profound States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of great capacity for buſineſs, one that adminiſters Affairs with much prudence and diſpatch, or a great Scholar, one of large Revenues, ſplendid Train and Attendants, and perhaps ſometimes, but more rarely, a virtuous, juſt, pious, holy and very ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual minded perſon, I ſay, to honour ſome of theſe with the Titles of <hi>Incomparable, Prodigious,</hi> and other ſignifications of aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment: and yet to have very little of theſe in their Souls to God, from whom all theſe and the Subjects of them came, and who is the Authour of all theſe, and all other never ſo great and never ſo little things in the World; to whoſe Infinite Perfection all thoſe and all other compared are not ſo much as one Atome to the content of the ſtarry Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and <hi>whoſe is the Kingdom, the Power, and the Glory for ever and ever:</hi> and this even when they make their moſt ſolemn Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes and pretend to Worſhip him? And ſo likewiſe it is a ſign of pitiable ignorance
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:94938:182"/> or folly in men to be more confident and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, to put their truſt more in the ſavour and power of an ordinary Relation, or Friend, poſſibly in a man's ſelf, in his own Power, Wit, Prudence, Riches, Strength, than in the All-mighty, All-wiſe and All-good God, for which indeed ſometimes there may be reaſon if their deſigns or hopes be unjuſt. Who would not be moved to contempt or pity to hear men proteſt with the greateſt zeal and earneſtneſs to one ſome very little their ſuperiour, how much they are their ſervants, and with all the geſtures that may be, ſignifie it? but when they profeſs their Univerſal Obedience to God, <hi>the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, the only Potentate,</hi> the Supreme Monarch of Heaven and Earth, in ſaying, <hi>thy Kingdom come, thy Will be done in Earth as it is in Heaven,</hi> or in any other words, to do it ſo remiſsly, coldly, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently that if they ſhould do in like manner to any one little their betters, they would think themſelves ſo unjuſtly negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted as to bid them, or to be content they ſhould keep their ſervice to themſelves. Who could like to ſee men with great reality and ſubmiſſion to confeſs their Offences againſt thoſe they fear can puniſh them? but to confeſs to God their Offences againſt his Laws, as if they were afraid they ſhould do ſo again, and were very loth and unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:94938:182"/> to prevent it. To ſee men with a great deal of earneſtneſs and humility, and mouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of bleſſing render thanks to their Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for a ſatisfying meals meat when hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, or a refreſhing draught when thirſty, or a ſcrap of ſilver to buy them neceſſaries when deſtitute; but to thank God both in their publick and private Devotion for his innumerable Benefits, even all good things that ever we have had in our lives, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for ſpiritual ones, as if it were a meer Compliment or Ceremony, and they would gladly have done with it, as ſoon as may be. And laſtly, How great a ſenſeleſneſs and ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſneſs is it in men to beg with ſo much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of thoſe in whoſe power it is to puniſhneſs them a little in temporary good things, forgiveneſs and pardon, or of others their favour, countenance, aſſiſtance, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, counſel, their Alms or Charity; or in poor Priſoners guilty and ready to be condemned to mulcts, baniſhment or corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral pain or death, to Cry out with the moſt pitiful Voice for Mercy or Pardon: but to ask of God Grace to Repent, ſtrength to be better, and then pardon for innumerable leſſer and many greater and more heinous Sins, That God who can make them miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable here and hereafter, who can throw both Body and Soul into Hell, would <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us our Treſpaſses, as we forgive thoſe
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:94938:183"/> that treſpaſs againſt us;</hi> to ask of him to take care of them and provide for them, to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and direct them: I ſay, to ask theſe and all other things of God, as if they were unwilling he ſhould grant them, or very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different and little concerned whether he did or no, or as if God were obliged to them that they would ask and receive any thing from him: What can be more abſurd, more unreaſonable, more ſhameful than this? This is not Superſtition, but Truth and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. And this ſlackneſs, ſtreightneſs, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>functorineſs in the Worſhip of God comes from Senſuality or Immorality or both; Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men are dull and carnal and cannot take notice of, and be affected much with God who is a ſpirit, or they are unwilling to do it, they care not how little, becauſe they know they do ſuch things, and live in ſuch courſes as do not pleaſe him, and which he doth not allow of. Of this their Duty they may do a little, it may be, to appeaſe ſome remainder of the natural appetite that all men have to Worſhip God, and for Credit or Reputation ſake, and that's enough. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray to the excellent Examples and Precepts which we have in the Holy Scriptures. There can hardly be given any more certain ſigns of the greateſt ſtrength and fervour of all thoſe Operations of the Soul in Prayer than what we meet withal in the <hi>Pſalms</hi> every where.</p>

I have before inſtanced in the 51 <hi>Pſal.</hi> where <hi>David</hi> ſo vehemently and earneſtly
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:94938:186"/> begs for Purification, Pardon, Peace. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed his Sins were great and hainous, and much aggravated; and ſo we muſt have a care that we imitate him when the things we deſire are of as great concernment, our degrees of Earneſtneſs and Affection muſt be proportioned always to the importance or good effects of the action, moſt what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon the goodneſs of the objects thereof: but I doubt it is but too ordinary for Chriſtians to be guilty of more, and more hainous ſins than <hi>David</hi>'s were, and yet not to uſe the leaſt part of the Importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity that <hi>David</hi> here doth for forgivneſs, if they do deſire it at all, and make not a ſport at it. And ſo of other good things they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take not themſelves to God. St. <hi>James</hi> tells us, that the effectual fervent Prayer of a righteous man availeth much, or the active Prayer, that in which there is much of activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and life [<gap reason="foreign">

Our Saviour after he had given his Diſciples an Example of Prayer, he adds an adviſement of great importunity in Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (ſometimes and for ſome things when neceſſary, and of great importance) and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:94938:187"/> that ſometime it may be a condition of our receiving what we ask. <hi>Luke 11. Verſe 5. And he ſaid unto them, Which of you ſhall have a friend, and ſhall go unto him at midnight, and ſay unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves; for a friend of mine in his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is come to me, and I have nothing to ſet before him,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Verſe 8.

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>] becauſe of his Impudence properly (that is, Importunity ſo great as it might ſeem near to that, or as men impudent uſe to do, who without the reſtraint of fear or ſhame do things and with the greateſt vigour and ferventneſs) <hi>he will riſe and give him as many as he need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi> And verily it may ſometimes be very reaſonable for God to with-hold any benefit asked, eſpecially if a great one, on purpoſe to heighten the eagerneſs and fervency of our deſires, that we might be more ſenſible of our dependence upon him, and obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him, and be more thankful when we do receive after ſuch long importunity. And it might reaſonably ſeem good to God net to give the thing at firſt, or with only cold and luke-warm wiſhes and deſires; nay, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to give it, if we will not take the pains to continue and invigorate, inliven our Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications and Entreaties. And this may
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:94938:187"/> often actually be one reaſon why, as St. <hi>James</hi> ſaith, we ask and receive not, namely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we ask ſo rarely and ſeldom, ſo weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, languidly, and remiſsly, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſo unbecommingly to the great and good God ſo infinitely ſuperiour to us, and to the things themſelves; the leaſt being too good to be given to ſuch idle and heartleſs Petitioners. Indeed a man may reaſonably think that rather than ſuch Prayers ſhould be the condition of receiving, they ſhould oftner be a cauſe of denial, or ſhould even as little be the condition of receiving as none at all, if not leſs. God may give us bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits indeed, but not on condition of ſuch Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; as he often doth, when we do not pray at all, ungrateful Creatures!</p>

He alſo who much addicteth himſelf to, and frequently uſeth this ſort of Prayer, may pray much more in the ſum, and moſt-what doth pray more fervently and more ſeaſonably than he that prayeth many long continued Prayers; his Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments, Confeſſions, Profeſſions, Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings, Petitions being when he is under a ſtronger and diſtincter apprehenſion and greater ſenſe of the things he conceives in his ſhort Prayer. As for publick Prayers they are determined by the Publick, and I do not ſee but that moſt men generally might, if they pleaſed, be there as often as they are appointed: many more than there are ſurely. But eſpecially thoſe whoſe affairs are not ſo much abroad, whoſe time and garb and other circumſtances might be more eaſily fitted thereto, whoſe affairs are more regular as to time, and more at their own diſpoſe. And if all thoſe were but preſent who ſtand ſtill looking about, or who pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:94938:189"/> find themſelves very little buſineſs as well to be done at another time, all thoſe who are either idle or do buſineſs of far leſs if of any concernment to be done juſt at that time, the number I do not doubt would be very conſiderably increaſed. And as for private and ſecret Prayers, ſurely moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may have opportunity to perform them once or twice a day in ſome length or other, or ſome part of the day or other. I confine them not to time nor length, though it may be beſt for men who can to fix ſome time, and to uſe to order their affairs ſo, as not to interrupt them, and that they may not be hindred by them, as poſſibly before them all, and after they be all diſpatcht. Better too they be ſhort than none at all; If it be but ſome ſhort and pithy comprehenſive form with the Lord's Prayer, of which ſome learned, judicious, pious and devout men have been ſo deſerving of the Publick as to give great variety, which men need not be ignorant of, if they have a mind to know. It is as a thing of great conſequence to be adviſed here, That thoſe who educate and look after Children, eſpecially Mothers (than which they cannot do a more tender Office of Love and Care) do cauſe their Children after riſing and before going to bed to utter ſome ſhort Sentences of Petition and the Lord's Prayer, and 'twould do well to
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:94938:190"/> add the Paraphraſe upon it in the Publick Catechiſm; and to learn them betimes to acknowledge and worſhip their Maker. And cannot then they do at leaſt ſo much, and it is like ſomewhat more themſelves? And might not all others find as much time as that will come to, if they had a mind to it? But this eſpecially, as I above ſaid, may they do whoſe affairs are known to be at certain times, whoſe affairs are more in their diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, and leſs indiſpoſe them, and ſuch eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially may they be whoſe affairs are moſt within doors and domeſtick, who are not wearied and tired with bodily labour; though perſons oft do this too more than they need, and when they need not. What ſhould hinder moſt perſons every day as ſoon as they riſe from retiring a little by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and alſo with their Families, ſo many as their affairs will ſpare (and let them not be ſpared without conſiderable neceſſity) praying to God to keep them from all ſin and danger that day and all their lives, to give them grace and peace, the good things of the Soul and of the Body, the good things of this Life and that which is to come, that they may live well, diſcreetly, innocently, beneficiently, profitably to their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, pleaſingly to God, comfortably to themſelves here, with peace and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded repoſe and joy, being prepared
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:94938:190"/> for a more perfect and happy Life in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Further, that they may have their Sins pardoned, true repentance for them inſtilled, obedience and holy reſolution ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited and confirmed in them; that they might love God, be grateful to their Friends, forbear and forgive, and do good to their Enemies, even to all, encourage Virtue and Goodneſs, check and reſtrain Vice and ill-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prudently in their place and calling, and with all ſincerity for the good of the World. That they might not that day be malicious, uncharitable, ſelfiſh, proud, ambitious, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, revengeful, vain-glorious, wrathful, ſenſual, laſcivious, intemperate, drunken, prophane by lewd ſwearing, irreverent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, or commit any other ſin they know themſelves to be moſt particularly in danger of. That they might be proſpered in worldly affairs, and delivered from the evils of Body, Name, Eſtate, as ſhall ſeem moſt fit to God. And ſo in like manner to give thanks for any of the good things they have received. I ſay, what ſhould hinder moſt men generally in ſome length or other from doing this in the morning, and ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe again at night, if they had a mind to it? Why may we not apply our minds to theſe things in a morning firſt (except upon an extraordinary occaſion) as well as to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcivious objects or worldly affairs, or the
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:94938:191"/> contrivance, it may be, of ſome ſin, ſome evil action or other? <hi>My voice ſhalt thou hear</hi> (or hear thou) <hi>in the morning, O Lord, in the morning will I direct my Prayer</hi> (or my ſelf) <hi>unto thee,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Evening and Morning and at Noon will I pray and cry aloud. Pſalm</hi> 5. 3. and <hi>Pſalm 55. Verſe</hi> 17. ſaith <hi>David.</hi> Theſe places indeed do not prove he did this always, or conſtantly uſed theſe ſtated times: but the firſt of them proves plainly at leaſt that he did it in the morning <hi>ſometimes,</hi> and the ſecond more probably. <hi>Evening, Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Noon</hi> may be alſo a ſynechdochical Expreſſion for praying to God very frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and at all times when he had occaſion. And ſo when it is ſaid <hi>ſeven times a day I will praiſe thee,</hi> may be meant only very often; and that it is likely by Ejaculatory Praiſes too, or that upon ſome days he might ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly perform it juſt ſo many times. And ſo that in the <hi>Theſſalonians, iſt. Epiſt. 5 Chap. 17 Verſe. Pray without ceaſing</hi>

In every thing,</hi> &amp;c. or praying ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry frequently, eſpecially Ejaculatory Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; or praying to the end of our Lives; it is a Duty which will never here be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, or to be left off. To do thus conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and frequently would much keep men
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:94938:191"/> ſober, diſcreet, conſciencious, upright the following day, and conſequently alſo fit them for God's Bleſſing in all their other af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and conſequently make them be joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and chearful, and benignly diſpoſed: whereas popping in now and then a Prayer, eſpecially before a Sacrament, or on a Lord's day (times which none that are ſo much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in worldly affairs ſhould omit by any means) will do much leſs good, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence ſoon wear out and be forgot, and then moſt of the Interval they are as bad as ever, and never the better. Finally, We may all take this adviſement and remember it, that whatever our affairs are, and how much-ſoever they neceſſarily hinder our thus worſhipping of God and this our Duty towards him; yet we are to take care this be not with our conſent, that we are not content there with, ſo as not to watch for an opportunity otherwiſe to diſpoſe them, and not to look upon it as an unhappineſs; let it not be want of good-will in us by no means; but let us be ſo diſpoſed that we would do it withal our heart, and much oftner, if we could, we believing it manifeſtly our perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be more immediately employed in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things, and to converſe with God. And I little doubt but that he that is ſo diſpoſed will ſoon find ſometimes or other, to perform this his reaſonable Duty to God.</p>
                  <pb n="332" facs="tcp:94938:192"/>
                  <p>We are to do this too as often as other af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs which are not of greater concernment may permit. And in this bodily Life in which we are, ſuppoſing it ought to be maintained, many called little affairs conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered without their conſequences, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with them are great matters. As due times and qualities and quantities of meat, drink, habitation, ſleep, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for without theſe no living; our bodies will not be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, nor ſit for Prayer, nor any thing ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpiritual or corporal to do it to any good purpoſe. And we may contract by ill uſe of theſe or want of theſe many evil diſpoſitions of mind, as moroſity, d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, too much ſerupuloſity, ſuperſtition, ſuſpicion of our ſelves and others, a belief that every thing that is in us is bad, never looking at any thing that is good in us, or thinking it is not ſo, fearfulneſs, unactive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, peeviſhneſs; ſo that it may be and full oft is of greater concernment to mind theſe ordinary affairs, neceſſities or conveniencies of this bodily life, than directly to pray. And if we do all theſe things with diſcretion, and that we may be more fitted to ſerve and pleaſe God by doing this way as we think the moſt good to the World we can, we do an act of Obedience and conſequently of Worſhip to God.</p>
                  <p>But, alas! this extreme of Praying more
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:94938:192"/> than the neceſſity of other affairs will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, is but rare in compare with the other of ſeldom or never praying, eſpecially in this irreligious and prophane Generation. How many are there who have hardly ever vouchſafed that they can remember One, <hi>O God,</hi> or ſo much as a <hi>Lord bleſs me</hi> ſeriouſly, except prophanely or cuſtomarily? much leſs do they ever allot a minute or two ſome-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>times to ſay with any underſtanding and affection any ſhort Prayer. And as for the Publick either they come thither not at all, but like Brute Beaſts lie ſotting and ſwilling or ſleeping at home: or when they come they poſſibly pray ſometimes as little as thoſe that are at home, or as the ſeats they ſit upon, or very gravely and imperiouſly they contemn it as below their wiſdom or their great mind; contrary to the practice of all even the moſt barbarous and ignorant Heathens of all ages, who all of them ever have had ſome things which they called God's (except ſome late Relations ſhould be true) which they thought could do them good or harm, to Worſhip; acknowledging, praiſing, thanking and praying to them. A ſign that the thing is ſo evidently uſeful and conſequently reaſonable to all who want any good thing they are capable of, and yet cannot give it themſelves, and know any other being who can; that the moſt ſtupid
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:94938:193"/> of Mankind are not ignorant, or negligent of it.</p>

                  <p>IV. THe Fourth Qualification is, that our Prayers be ſeaſonable, both the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the Duty of Prayer in general containing all the parts before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and alſo all the ſeveral parts thereof. And by <hi>ſeaſonable</hi> I mean, that both the whole and ſuch parts thereof be then uſed, when they do the moſt good; when they will do more good than to omit them, or to do another thing, or to uſe another part of Prayer in their place. The ſeaſon or oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of every action is when it will do more good than the omiſſion thereof, or another action in its place and time; and the beſt ſeaſon is when it will do moſt good, more than the omiſſion thereof.</p>
                  <p>And (1.) That the whole action or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance (of ſet Prayer which requires any ſet time or place I ſpeak principally) be ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable. For while we are in this fleſhly life, ſuppoſing it our duty to maintain our ſelves in it, or rather to do all the good we can (which is God's ſervice in this fleſhly life) and as long as we can, there are a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of things in their times of more good
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:94938:193"/> effect than praying at the ſame time would be, as I have before ſaid. Such are our food, ſleep, exerciſe, and that in ſuch certain quantity or quality: For without theſe we either cannot at all ſubſiſt in this life, or very untowardly with diſtempers, pains, dulneſs, indiſpoſedneſs to the beſt actions of Soul, and conſequently even theſe in Prayer. In general we muſt and ought to take ſo much care of, and allow ſo much attendence and time to our bodies that they may be the fitteſt inſtruments for our ſouls, that they may the leaſt hinder, and the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit or help or diſpoſe them to the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect actions they are capable of; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently whereby while we are in this body we may do the moſt good. And this is as various and diverſe as there are perſons. For ſome perſons tempers and conſtitutions may be ſo happy as that a little attendence to their body ſerves turn, and the reſt of their time they may ſpend in more im<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately momentous actions. Others again may be of ſo unhappy and weakly a one, that moſt of their time muſt neceſſarily be employed about their bodies, that they may have ſome and but a ſmall time for the more uſeful and excellent actions of life, ſuch as Prayer contains; and if they did not ſpend ſo much time about their bodies they ſhould be able to ſpend yet leſs or none
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:94938:194"/> at all about their ſouls. And yet even theſe perſons if they do but <hi>ultimately</hi> propoſe to themſelves ſincerely to do all the good they are able for, and to pleaſe God thereby, ſo far as they do ſo are very innocent and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. And if they mightily deſire and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly wiſh they were able to do the greateſt good as much as the moſt knowing, ſtrong or powerful, or are in ſincerity ſtrongly reſolved and bent if they had never ſo much power they would uſe it all to ſerve and pleaſe God by doing good with it; I ſay, if they be thus affected (which is but rare for want of uſe in perſons who cannot employ their minds much and often and attentively about Moral and Divine things) they are moſt excellently virtuous and good; and, it may be, more than thoſe which can ſpend more time in ſet Prayer, and ſincerely and fervently performed too. Some of theſe very weakly perſons being often indifferent and little concerned for worldly things by uſing themſelves to the propoſal of this end and moſt frequently attending to it even in their ſmall actions of life, and by God's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate influence may arrive to as great or a greater degree of Virtue than thoſe who can ſpend more time even in ſet Prayers duly performed; much more ſtill if there want the due end thereof or ſincerity, and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency.</p>
                  <pb n="337" facs="tcp:94938:194"/>
                  <p>It is not ſeaſonable for perſons to ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to pray premeditated, <hi>extempore</hi> or any other long Prayers when they want ſtrength through paſt bodily or intellectual toil and labour, or ſickneſs and infirmity; for men will then do little good by their Prayers, and alſo, it may be, indiſpoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to do twenty times more afterwards both by their Prayers and otherwiſe, whilſt they contract more Diſtempers and Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of Body, or in general more inept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to do any good. Meer dulneſs indeed may be overcome by Reſolution, and it may be good ſomtimes ſo to do, but weakneſs cannot.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it ſeaſonable when a man's mind is filled with other thoughts of lawful or neceſſary buſineſs and in purſuit thereof to uſe a long premeditated or <hi>extempore</hi> Prayer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The moſt ſeaſonable Prayers then would be ſome Form and frequent Ejaculations. There are alſo a multitude of other actions where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by at certain times we may do more good, of which in the ſum there will be greater good effect than if we prayed at thoſe times<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as Reading, Meditation, Study or Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation any ways to inform our ſelves with the moſt uſeful knowledge of God, his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Providence, of the Revelation of his Will by Chriſt or our Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, of our ſelves, of Humane Nature,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:94938:195"/> what men are, what they ſhould be, how they come to be ſo bad or ignorant or er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous, how they might come to be better or wiſer. One good effect of which know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is to make us more able and fit to pray as we ought, and according to thoſe very directions that I have and ſhall give, that we may pray things juſt, true, important, the moſt general good things, and the greateſt variety of particular ones; that our minds may be well furniſhed with theſe things; that we may pray ſincerely, fervently, as frequently as we can, and ſeaſonably; that we may well expreſs and convey both our ſenſe and affections to others with whom we pray. And indeed one Reaſon why this Duty hath been of late ſo ill, ſo uſeleſly, offenſively and miſchievouſly performed, and ſo may likewiſe hereafter again is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome men have been perpetually pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſpent ſo much time in the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of this Duty, but little or none in the reflection upon it, or examination of it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ſuch Rules as I now propoſe; and much leſs in the ſtudy and conſideration of thoſe things and others juſt now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
                  <p>There are times likewiſe of doing more good by relieving the indigent and deſerving perſons with what they moſt want, of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting the ſick, of inſtructing, reproving,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:94938:195"/> exhorting, reconciling and determining of differences, of any ways helping or aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another in any of his affairs. A Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand other ways there are of doing good which have alſo their times, that is, they are then in ſuch circumſtances the beſt we can do, or we can do the moſt good there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. Now if when we ſhould be doing theſe things we ſhould betake our ſelves to pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it would be unſeaſonable. Moreover, in order to the getting or preſerving or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing our power or ability to do good ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to our ſelves or others, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſerve God; more particularly in order to the obtaining preſerving or augmenting the good things of Food, Raiment, Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Reſt, and conſequently Health and Strength, Liberty, (not being a Servant to others by Debts, Engagements) Good-name, Authority, opportunity and leiſure of gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Inſtruction and Knowledge and Virtue by Reading, Meditation, Conference, final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Riches, by which all theſe things are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obtained, or in part; I ſay, in order to this, every perſon hath ſome Calling, ſome Action of Life or other to which he most<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what applies himſelf, and the former good things are the reward or ſome way the effect of his diligence and honeſty therein. In this it is the greateſt part of mens lives are taken up. How much of a mans life is to
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:94938:196"/> be ſpent therein, and when it will do moſt good to employ himſelf there and when elſewhere, every mans own ſincere pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence (as it muſt in all the other actions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore recited) governed by reaſon, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, advice of the moſt ſober, diſcreet, wiſe and virtuous men muſt only determine. This in general is certain, that it is not of beſt effect for men to fill up all their Lives with the affairs of their Calling, and to leave no room for the Worſhipping of God by praying to him, and then either think really or pretend there is no ſeaſon at all: and yet we may alſo be too mindleſs of them. For Example, It would be unſeaſonable to ſet apart a day of praying, and it may be for a good Harveſt among other things, when we ſhould be reaping; to be ſtanding ſtill and praying for deliverance from a danger when we ſhould be flying from it. We are not to be praying with let and long Prayers (Eja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culatory may always be uſed) for any good thing, or prevention or removal of any evil, when we ſhould be endeavouring, not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring when we ſhould be doing. We are not to be like the man, who ſeeing a houſe falling upon his head falls upon his knees and crys out God help him and deliver him, but will not ſtir out of the place. There is indeed but little danger hereof in temporal and ſenſible good things, but in ſpiritual, I
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:94938:196"/> doubt, it is frequent, where men perhaps pray much and often to God to be ſanctified, to be ſecured from God's wrath or the effects of his anger, but take no care and uſe no endeavour at any time to obtain the one or prevent the other. Some of that very time, poſſibly, may be better and more ſeaſonably ſpent in meditating, conſidering, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, reſolving, informing, inculcating things upon themſelves. Moſt commonly this ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of all endeavours is a ſign of formality, or of want of ſincerity, or at leaſt of fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency in our Prayers. Sometimes indeed in perſons of a more movable and changable temper there may be in their Prayers ſome real flaſhes of ſtrong affections without any conſequent endeavour; the next minute almoſt thoſe thoughts and affections being forgotten and they being as much taken up and affected with the variety of any other objects which ſucceed.</p>
                  <p>2. Our Prayers are to be ſeaſonable as to the parts or ſeveral Ingredients. Sometimes a greater part of a Prayer may be ſpent in acknowledgments; as when our minds are dull and inſenſible of the Perfections and Excellencies of God, of our entire depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon him, of our being perfectly at his diſpoſe, of our own inſufficiency to be or do any the leaſt thing for our ſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him: then, I ſay, we may more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:94938:197"/> and largely take notice of and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Divine Perfections and our own Imperfections. Sometimes Confeſſions of Sins and Petition for ſtrength to amend and for forgiveneſs may be moſt ſeaſonably en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged; as upon ſuch times as prudently are appointed for a publick and ſolemn Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance as it were of any number and company together. The ſame may be done ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably by perſons in ſecret and retiredly by themſelves. Sometimes Thankſgiving may be moſt ſeaſonably inſiſted upon, an enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merating of the many favours and bleſſings of God with correſpondent affections of thanks and love therefore, producing the effects of Obedience, Reſolutions and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to pleaſe God. It may ſometimes be the beſt to ſpend moſt of the time in Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, to do it very particularly, yet in things of concernment, and which we moſt want.</p>
                  <p>3. Our Prayers are to be ſeaſonable as to the particular Inſtances of theſe parts or Ingredients. Thus ſometimes it may be ſeaſonable in acknowledgment moſt to inſiſt upon God's Power or Wiſdom or Goodneſs, or ſome ſingle Inſtances of any of theſe his Attributes: to mention others may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent or unſeaſonable, it may exclude thoſe things which would do more good. Of this we cannot want Inſtances in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:94938:197"/> occaſions of addreſſes to God both in publick forms and private uſages of our lives, where notwithſtanding they are oft too generally or improperly uſed. To give thanks and petition very particularly and copiouſly for many things, when the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is ſpecial for one thing (as at meat) is moſt-what unſeaſonable: but to do i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> for the benefit then received is ſeaſonable. To confeſs ſome Sins with thoſe who are not guilty of them is unſeaſonable; or if they be, to do it too particularly, and when it would be interpreted to proceed from Pride or Envy, then to mention ſuch things would be unſeaſonable. To confeſs thoſe Sins which the perſon and company have been truly moſt guilty of, which are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he moſt frequently committed, and yet it may be the moſt unobſerved by them, and they are the moſt inſenſible of them may be ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. To pray for what we do not want is unſeaſonable. As to pray to God to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us from our great Enemies, and ſave us, when we have none we know to invade us, and therefore to imitate thoſe which have. To pray for thoſe things which we cannot uſe well now if we had them, and to neglect thoſe things which we do moſt want, and which in our circumſtances we could beſt uſe would be unſeaſonable: but contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe in the place of ſuch Petitions always
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:94938:198"/> to pray for thoſe things we want and can then beſt uſe is to petition ſeaſonably. In general it is certain ſome things are to be pray'd for at one time, and ſome at another, ſome in one company private or publick, and ſome in another. The variety is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, every mans prudence muſt determine. He will be better provided ſo to do if he do but attend to and remember, that he is to do every thing when it may do moſt good, and more than any other thing he could at that time do in its place.</p>
                  <p>4. Let our Prayers be ſeaſonable as to ſome Adjuncts of Prayer, ſuch as vehemency or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſeneſs and length, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As for Example, Let not our deſires (and ſo any other Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient of our Prayers) be ſo vehement and intenſe in things of ſmall importance and uſe as in great, for ſo we ſhall make no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. In length let us not be long when other Actions and Company are deſigned, and expect us after a very little time, of which it is eaſie to give inſtances.</p>
                  <p>Finally, This ſeaſonableneſs in all theſe reſpects and many more, is left to the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of every particular perſon to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by his own reaſon, experience and obſervation, the example and advice of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet and good perſons. In this and all other actions if a man doth as he judgeth he ought to do, and his end be always ſincerely
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:94938:198"/> to do the beſt he underſtands, and he deſires to do the moſt good and be the moſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to God, he never ſins: and ſuch a perſon is always ready to be adviſed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed for the beſt. It is manifeſt too, what need there is of Prudence as in all our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſo in this more eſpecially of Prayer, that it in all the reſpects mentioned may be ſeaſonably performed; and that ſometimes it may not be ſo unſeaſonably, as to do more hurt than good by excluding ſomething bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out of its place.</p>
                  <p>5. We Chriſtians who know and believe what Jeſus Chriſt is and hath taught muſt always make our Petitions in the Name of the <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> that is, for his ſake, to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him, and conſequently the eminent and illuſtrious merits of his exact obedience to God and of his ſpotleſs and generous Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Holineſs for our encouragement to our imitation. That ſeems to be part of the ſenſe of thoſe Expreſſions of our Saviour, <hi>John 14. 13. 14. Whatſoever ye ſhall ask in my Name, that I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son: If ye ask any thing in my Name I will do it.</hi> And indeed it is highly reaſonable, that ſince we have all been more or leſs ſinners, the puniſhment for our ſins (which is at leaſt the deprivation of God's favour) upon our true repentance ſhould be remitted, and conſequently all the poſitive
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:94938:199"/> inſtances of God's favour and good-will (of which the granting our Petitions is a very comprehenſive one) ſhould be afforded us for the ſake and honour of ſuch a perfectly holy and virtuous perſon as Jeſus was. That which eaſily might be made appear more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly if it were here neceſſary or proper. And ſo much may ſuffice at preſent for the due Qualifications of our Actions or Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Soul in Prayer.</p>

                  <p>I Proceed to the due Qualifications of the Signs to be uſed in our Prayers, the Signs both of the Senſe or Objects in our Prayers, and of the Actions or Operations of our Souls converſant about them. Theſe as hath been before ſaid are either Speech or Geſtures. Among Geſtures are to be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned all other qualities of our Speech be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the articulateneſs of it, called <hi>Words,</hi> by which our Conceptions or Thoughts are ſignified: ſuch as are acuteneſs and gravity, intenſneſs and remiſsneſs or loudneſs and lowneſs, ſwiftneſs and ſlowneſs, equality and inequality, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To obſerve ſome Directions concerning theſe, eſpecially concerning Speech, may not be altogether uſeleſs to thoſe who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:94938:199"/> Prayers whether written or pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced for others. But becauſe it concerns many ſuch who may be better able to direct themſelves, I ſhall be very brief in them. Thoſe which I ſhall mention at preſent ſhall be theſe Eight.</p>
                  <p>(1.) The firſt and moſt general one, is that the ſigns both of our Senſe and Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Soul, of what we ſay and what we do in Prayer may the beſt convey the things deſigned to be ſignified to the Auditours, or Readers if they be written: that they may cauſe them the moſt perfectly to conceive and underſtand our thoughts, paſſions, and other operations of our minds. This is the only uſe of Signs, and all their goodneſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in this.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="10" type="section">
                  <head>SECT. X.</head>
                  <p>(2.) ANd more particularly as a means to this general End, let theſe Signs, <hi>viz.</hi> Speech and Geſture be ſuch as do not take off the mind either of him who recites or compoſes the Prayer, or of others who joyn with him from the things ſignified. Which they may do two ways. (1.) By too much pleaſing <hi>abſolutely</hi> in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or by ſome other qualities in them
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:94938:200"/> beſides their aptneſs to ſignifie, as by their novelty, modiſhneſs, variety, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> theſe full often may make greater impreſſions upon us than the things ſignified. Such oft-times are words and phraſes of the neweſt faſhion, and uſed by perſons whoſe acquaintance or converſe is eſteemed honourable; ſuch are ſtyles with a very careful juſtneſs of number, ſound, poſition of ſyllables and words in each ſentence or period; ſuch are many fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurative ſpeeches: where partly the things themſelves from whence they are taken, as that they are ſublime, vaſt, unwonted, ſtrange, difficult; partly the qualities in the compoſer of which they are ſigns, as of good invention, perception and judgment, having read the beſt Authors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may ſo much affect men with admiration, eſteem or delight as to intercept and detain their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention from the thing firſt deſigned to be ſignified and to cauſe them to be little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing regarded. And accordingly it may be often obſerved, that in a Sermon or Prayer the Language and Expreſſion is remembred and commended; when the Senſe or Matter, eſpecially if it be practical, is quite forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as a thing not worthy to be taken notice of. It is true, all the acceptable qualities and ornaments of Speech are laudable in a performance where it is deſigned to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and pleaſe men with them. For it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:94938:200"/> a good Judgment of the fitneſs of the means for the end, as in Poetry Orations and feigned Hiſtories: but they are very ſparingly at leaſt to be uſed in thoſe Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes whoſe end is quite another thing, <hi>viz.</hi> the conveyance of Divine Thoughts and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. This fault is committed common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by perſons who are either imprudent or vain, either thoſe who are not adviſed of the end of ſuch religious Dutys as Prayer, or if they be they cannot reſtrain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from uſing whatſoever they eſteem themſelves for, and think they ſhall pleaſe others with.</p>
                  <p>But (2.) on the other hand theſe Signs may take off our minds from the things ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by offending and diſpleaſing. Such are in general all ſuch as ſignifie together with the thing to be conveyed ſome conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable imperfection in him that conveys, which alſo are called indecent. More parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, ſuch are affected Words and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, too vulgar and ſlovenly Similitudes from Shops and Trades and Childrens Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, Words uſed ill by the ruder and meaner ſort of people, ſome ſorts of Tones and Flexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Voice. Theſe things ſignifie vanity and oſtentation, a meanneſs of mind, one much converſant about and affected with mean things and yet not diſcerning it, rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, incivility, ſometimes ſomething bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:94938:201"/> upon ſenſuality, puſillanimity, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, or too great fear of little things, want of wiſdom and generoſity. All which and ſuch like diſpleaſe, offend, raiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt or pity in the Auditours of moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. If at any time our prudence ſhould judge it neceſſary to uſe ſomething like ſuch Expreſſions to ſome perſons, it ſhould be ſo done as to ſignifie withal our condeſcenſion, and our prudential choice of them by reaſon of the imperfection of the perſons who occaſion it.</p>

                  <head>SECT. XI.</head>
                  <p>(3.) LEt the ſigns of our Conceptions, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, <hi>&amp;c. viz.</hi> Speech and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture be ſuch as may rather ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what pleaſe and invite the mind to attend to them and conſequently much more to the things ſignified. Such are Words and Phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which are the moſt proper, that is, which are uſed to ſignifie any one thing and no other: ſuch alſo are Metaphors or Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes where the terms are very like, and which are very well known and underſtood. By theſe men conceive diſtinctly, clearly, eaſily what we would convey to them: all which pleaſe the mind and conſequently cauſe it longer to employ it ſelf thus, and
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:94938:201"/> more to attend. Such, laſtly, is that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called <hi>plain</hi> ſpeech; that is, that which very perfectly conveys and ſignifies the things to be ſignified, which is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal and ſubſtantial uſe of ſpeech, without any or with very few and thoſe the moſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ornaments thereof; ſuch therefore which hath nothing which doth offend or is unacceptable, but yet hath very little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the ſubſtantial and chief uſe of ſpeech to pleaſe or delight. This language is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly uſed by plain men, that is, thoſe who uſe Language as they do Clothes principally for warmth and conveniency, following the faſhion and uſing the modiſh Ornaments thereof only ſo far as not to offend or to render<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their company acceptable, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be ſomewhat agreeable. All which is a ſign of diſcretion and good government, that one knows what is of great and what is of ſome though but of little good effect, and accordingly prizes and eſteems it. Which very thing again begets a good opinion of the ſpeaker or compoſer and conſequently much diſpoſeth to attend to and approve what he ſhall deliver.</p>
                  <p>In the number of pleaſing and acceptable ſigns in a Prayer pronounced, are good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment and geſture: amongſt which may be truly reckoned all properties of ſpeech beſides its articulation, as is before ſaid:
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:94938:202"/> ſuch as vehemency and ſoftneſs or elevation and depreſſion, quickneſs and ſlowneſs, equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and inequality, the poſitions or ſites of theſe called accent and tone. All which if they ſeem to be natural and not affected or counterfeited may be ſigns of ſome worthy and uſeful quality in us, ſuch as ſeriouſneſs, gravity, ſincere and earneſt deſire to do good, of ſome degree of wiſdom or good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe are to be uſed at the ſame time with our ſpeech or ſigns of our concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to accompany them to cauſe perſons to attend thereto in ſuch manner as is afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="12" type="section">
                  <head>SECT. XII.</head>
                  <p>IV. THe ſigns of the conceptions and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of our Souls, <hi>viz.</hi> Speech and geſture ought to be the moſt univerſal: that is to all our Auditors and Readers as much as may be. Let them be ſuch therefore as are uſed by the generality of <hi>them</hi> and moſt frequently. It is beſt to uſe the moſt common and received words among them to ſignifie our meaning by: And if we can find none, (as often we ſhall not when our conceptions are and ought to be more diſtinct) we muſt come the neareſt we can and take thoſe which are moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:94938:202"/> to ſome other that are uſed. If an Auditory be mixed (as all are more or leſs and much more the number of Readers) and one kind of words may ſignifie better to ſome perſons, and others again better to others, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> varriety of them more or leſs is moſt convenient to be uſed. There are alſo other prudent reaſons of variety of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions ſometimes: As becauſe one and the ſame perſon may not underſtand ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers entire ſenſe by any one phraſe but only one part of it; but by more he may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the whole. So alſo one may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand anothers entire ſenſe by one phraſe but <hi>obſcurely;</hi> but by another added there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>more clearly.</hi> Accordingly we ſee men practiſe in ordinary converſation, that where they have a mind to have themſelves well underſtood, and ſuſpect one or more perſons do not underſtand them they uſe variety of ſpeech and geſture too.</p>
                  <p>Another reaſon of variety may be its uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs for attention and memory and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. A man oftner and longer attends to the ſame thing ſignified by two or three ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions than by one: and then more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention makes a greater impreſſion, and the thing is better remembred. A thing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by one word or phraſe only, another immediarely ſucceeding, is oft-times quite miſſed or ſo ſlightly attended to that it is
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:94938:203"/> not at all remembred. Whence moſt of the things ſo delivered do but little good. This is alſo a reaſon of repetition of the ſame words or phraſes.</p>
                  <p>Againſt this rule do they offend who chuſe words and phraſes unknown to all or the greateſt part of an Auditory when there are other well known to them which might have been taken. Such are words newly made out of a Foreign Language when there are as good in our own; or thoſe which are indeed in our own Language, but are not uſed at all by our preſent Auditors, but by another ſort of perſons only as Scholars or Courtiers ſuppoſe.</p>
                  <p>The like may be in geſtures or ſigns of our affections, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we may uſe thoſe in a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanick or ruſtick Auditory which only ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie to thoſe of ſcholaſtick or gentile con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.</p>
                  <p>Calmneſs and equableneſs of ſpeech and geſture (for Example) would ſignifie to theſe laſt ſort of perſons ſerious and long attention to, ſteady and conſtant affection for what one ſaith; but men of more active tempers, which are far the greateſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, will hardly believe him that uſeth it to be at all in earneſt, to mind and be affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much with what he ſaith they will think him dull; becauſe always when they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or thoſe with whom they have gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:94938:203"/> converſed have been ſeriouſly and much concerned for any thing, they have accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed themſelves to be loud and unequal in their ſpeech, and quick, fierce, multifa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in their geſtures. In ſuch caſe it may be adviſable to uſe in part only thoſe geſtures which thoſe men do and that with ſome marks of condeſcenſion, whereby a man may convey his ſenſe and affections to them, and ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> not confirm them in their bad uſage, but rather admoniſh them of their imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. For indeed they are not only ſigns but cauſes too of ſtrong and ungovernable paſſions moſt commonly for little things, and conſequently of raſh and blind actions. Rude and vulgar ſpeech and carriage are commonly the cauſes of rude and vulgar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
                  <p>But there is no greater breach of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection than to make Prayers in a Foreign Tongue. For here the words are ſo far from being ſigns of conceptions to all the Auditory, that they are ſigns to none at all, perhaps. And this is the foul fault of that Church which pretends to ſo much wiſdom and care in all her Conſtitutions, when hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any thing can argue a greater folly and tyranny.</p>
                  <p>Of this they have heard enough: though their pride and other ſelf-intereſts will never ſuffer them to acknowledge or amend any
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:94938:204"/> thing though never ſo fooliſh and miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous which others ſhall admoniſh and adviſe them of. Nay, theſe men do not only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point thoſe who pray with others to uſe ſuch a Language wich the Auditors do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, but alſo private perſons to pray <hi>Pater Noſter's, Ave Maria's</hi> and <hi>Gloria Patri's</hi> (a judicious Prayer indeed, for they uſe it for Petition too) when ſometimes they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not one Sentence of what they ſay.</p>

                  <p>(5.) LEt the ſigns of all the operations and actions of our Soul, particularly of our affections be the moſt natural. Such which are conjoyned in men generally with the things ſignified even without their wills or endeavours, nay, they are not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned without ſome difficulty. Theſe ſigns more certainly convey to others not only the <hi>knowledge</hi> or <hi>conception</hi> of the affections which are in us; but alſo the like <hi>affections, themſelves:</hi> nay, ſometimes they may be the cauſe of and excite, maintain or increaſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in our ſelves. For which reaſons as well as others all inſtituted and appointed ſigns are to be the moſt natural, and as little as may be purely arbitrary. Theſe laſt are
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:94938:204"/> very often ſeparated from the thing ſignified which is called <hi>formality.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A common inſtance too of the unnatural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſignification of our affections, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is that we call <hi>over-doing, i. e.</hi> too many and too great a vehemency of geſtures and words, as it ſeems to moſt Auditors. Theſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſometimes in ſome perſons that uſe them they may be ſigns natural enough to themſelves of good affections (for there are degrees in reſpect of time and perſons) yet by the generality of Auditors they are judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to proceed from oſtentation or meer heat of bodily temper.</p>
                  <p>And here we may be admoniſhed that we do not uſe thoſe which are very natural ſigns to the generality of an Auditory hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critically; that we do not uſe them on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to beget in them a good opinion of us and to judge that we have ſuch good affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or other worthy qualities in us when we have not, nor care, perhaps, much whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we have them at all really, ſo we may but ſeem ſo. We may be further adviſed that they do not proceed from or are conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent upon meerly the heat, motion, agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, temper of body. For there are ſome perſons in whom ſighs, tears, loudneſs or vehemency of ſpeech (for Example) do not proceed from nor are conjoyned with their reſpective paſſions of ſadneſs, grief, earneſt
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:94938:205"/> deſire towards any certain objects appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended evil or good: but meerly from the frame and temper, or in one word, from the mechaniſm of their body: they cannot tell you what it is that ſo affects them. In others again they are very eaſie and great from every ſmall degree of real paſſion in them. We may ſee in their abundance of tears, deep and frequent ſighs, great vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency and variety of ſpeech and geſture, whence generally we may think they are brim-full of extraordinary paſſions, when in truth it is not ſo: and either there is none of thoſe paſſions at all, or but in very mean and ſlight degree.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe that affect and endeavour theſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſigns of ſanctity in Prayers, and ſo in Preaching and all other their Converſation, without the things ſignified for reputation and good opinion or any other ſelf-intereſt are Hypocrites in intention and deſign: The other in whom they proceed from other cauſes than thoſe they for the moſt part naturally ſignifie, but without their will or endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour are Hypocrites only in event and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: They both often deceive the World: but the <hi>firſt</hi> more ſeldom and chiefly by their own fault; the <hi>ſecond</hi> more frequently and by others fault, <hi>viz.</hi> by reaſon of their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and thinking thoſe ſigns univerſal which are not: and oft-times they are diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:94938:205"/> eſpecially by more obſerving Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors: which, when it happens, offends much and cauſeth them to be a verſe from and not to attend to what ſhall be ſaid by ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
                  <p>All external ſigns uſed before there is the thing ſignified in us are not hypocritical; They may be prudently uſed on purpoſe to excite or increaſe good thoughts and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in us, and to prevent the ill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of our bad example. As kneeling and intention of the voice may not only be ſigns of reverence and affection but alſo the cauſes; they may beget, preſerve and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe them in our ſelves and others by our Examples. And it may be one good effect of a ſet Tone in Prayers as well as in other parts of Divine Worſhip to excite and ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie ſutable affections.</p>

                  <p>(6.) LEt the expreſſions or ſigns of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions and thoughts convey them the moſt clearly in oppoſition to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity. Obſcurity and confuſion of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of a thing are not the ſame. A man may ſee with his eye remote objects confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly without diſtinction of their parts, yet ſtrongly and clearly; and on the contrary
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:94938:206"/> near objects very diſtinctly, but yet darkly or obſcurely. And ſo it is in the minds per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of objects.</p>
                  <p>Contrary to this direction <hi>generally</hi> are Tropical Speeches, as <hi>Metaphors, Metony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:</hi> by which names if we reſpect their Etymology all ſigurative ſpeeches might be called. <hi>i. e.</hi> when a thing is ſignified or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed not by a word proper to its <hi>eſſential nature;</hi> but by ſome one which is proper to ſomething related to it; as its <hi>cauſe, effect, part, like, contrary.</hi> The uſe of this tropi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſpeech ſeems to me to have been one of the greateſt impediments of good know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the World. I ſay <hi>generally</hi> not <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,</hi> &amp;c. For ſometimes a man may better know the <hi>cauſe, effect, or like of a thing</hi> than its <hi>eſſential nature:</hi> and then it will be better to endeavour to convey the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or conception of this <hi>eſſential nature</hi> by a word which properly ſignifies to him its <hi>cauſe, effect, or like, &amp;c.</hi> and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we often ſee that we are ſain to deſcribe, eſpecially an intellectual thing by its like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, effects, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to make ſome perſons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand and conceive it. But I am ſlipping too far into a Philoſophical Digreſſion. To apply this direction more uſefully. It is particularly to be obſerved, That many Scripture-Words and Phraſes which are fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurative though often uſed do not convey
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:94938:206"/> their ſenſe to the generality of Auditors or Readers ſo clearly as proper words now in common uſe among us: both becauſe they are figurative and alſo becauſe the things from whence they are taken and other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of ſpeech are nothing near ſo well known to us now as they were then to thoſe to whom they were firſt ſpoken or written, or as the natures of the things themſelves. There are many Metaphors, Allegorys and other figurative ſpeeches of the Scripture, eſpecially of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment uſed ordinarily in Prayers and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons which people generally do not at all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> am ſure they would far more clearly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the ſenſe it ſelf deſigned to be ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by them if it were expreſſed by the moſt ſit words of our own Language. Of this it were eaſie to give inſtances.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, Many things in the Scripture might have been more clearly by proper <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when we uſe Scripture-Phraſes which are not clear enough of themſelves (as it may be often ſit for the Authority and better memory of what we ſay, This Rule as well as the reſt having their exceptions) it will be moſt prudent for us to paraphraſe or to explicate them by the ſpeech moſt proper for the things now in uſe with us, of which ſome inſtances are given in a following Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. Hereby alſo many confuſed and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous conceits in the ſenſe of Scripture would be prevented. The Holy Scripture is the moſt abuſed piece of writing extant that I know: and that not only by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned always, and eſpecially of late (among us, but many times by ſome of the learned Fathers, Councels, Poſtillers. And if men ſhould have explicated and uſed the Text of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> or the Terms of any Science with as little underſtanding as they do the Holy Scriptures they would have expoſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſhame enough. But becauſe the Holy Scriptures are of ſo mighty concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to all ſorts of perſons, it is more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably permitted to them to be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant therein though with great defects and follys: (which notwithſtanding men

                  <p>(8.) LEt not theſe ſigns and expreſſions be longer than are needful for the moſt perfect conveyance of Thoughts or Affections, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As,</p>
                  <p>(1.) Not more words when one would ſerve; not a Sentence (by which I mean now not a <hi>Propoſition</hi> but <hi>many words</hi>) when one word may be had, and eaſilier too, which may ſerve; a great uſage of our modern ſtyle, whereby a great deal of paper and time is ſpent oft-times to little or no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                  <p>(2.) Not many different words or ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for the ſame thing, except for ſome ſuch reaſons as have and may be mentioned: as becauſe of the variety of Auditors, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their attention longer, or for memory, or to ſignifie affection, or on purpoſe to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure a thing, or for any other reaſon which prudence may think fit. The multitude of ideas of words and ſentences confound, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert or blunt the perception and attention of the mind to the conception of the things ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified.</p>
                  <p>(3.) Not more of the ſame words or ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences for the ſame thing, or not the ſame repeated, called <hi>Tautology,</hi> when a man
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:94938:208"/> ſaith the ſame thing in the ſame words. This doth in common uſe admit of frequent Exceptions. For it is better to uſe this <hi>Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tology</hi> than not, when the thing that is to be conveyed is very excellent, of great good uſe, and very neceſſary; for which there is and ought to be in the conveyer very great and ſomewhat laſting Affections or Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and conſequently his Attention to the thing it ſelf is ſo much and ſtrongly detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he neglects the alteration or variety of words to ſignifie it by, as if he had not time or leiſure for that. I ſay in ſuch caſe (which in Prayer is and ought to be a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent thing) <hi>Tautology</hi> or repeating the ſame words for the ſame things is and ought to be uſed, and is a natural ſign of real and ſtrong affections for excellent things, and particularly for that thing where it was uſed. And thus we ſee it on purpoſe uſed in ſome ſet Forms. But contrariwiſe, it is not allowable when it is uſed in mean and and ſmaller things compared with others in Prayer, and to which not ſo great and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Affection is to be given. For the time might have been better ſpent in atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to other things which might have ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded. It is not allowable meerly to gain time or lengthen our Prayers to no better purpoſe than that it might be ſaid we pray'd ſo long.</p>
                  <pb n="366" facs="tcp:94938:209"/>
                  <p>An Example of this <hi>Tautology</hi> is that fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent needleſs repetition of the ſame Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation of God or the like in Prayer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly taken notice of: The firſt fault of which is in the thoughts or conception, and proceeds from ignorance, ſlowneſs and dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or careleſsneſs, and conſequently ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Invention or Memory. For want of ſomething to ſucceed a man repeats the ſame thing till ſomething elſe do come: And then for the ſame want of invention in words too, he repeats the ſame thing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the ſame words. This <hi>Tautology</hi> as it ſpends time needleſly, ſo it offends alſo the Auditors, and diſpoſeth them at leaſt not to mind or attend to any thing the ſpeaker ſaith; either becauſe they judge it probable he will ſay nothing conſiderable; or that they might as it were puniſh him for, or diſcourage or diſapprove ſuch ignorance, dulneſs, ſlowneſs or careleſsneſs and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</p>
                  <p>That adviſement of our Saviour's to his Diſciples, <hi>that they ſhould not in their Prayers uſe vain Repetitions as the Heathens did, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they thought they ſhould be heard for their much ſpeaking (Matth. 6. Verſe</hi> 7.) as it may <hi>in general</hi> forbid all needleſs and unprofitable uſe of things or words in Prayer; ſo more <hi>particularly,</hi> as one Example or Inſtance of that general, to uſe, as the Heathens did,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:94938:209"/> multitude of things and words (whether various or the ſame, whether properly <hi>Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tology</hi> or not) out of an opinion that that ſhould be the cauſe of their being heard, or ſhould procure them audience. And that either becauſe they thought their Gods might not preſently hear them, but might be employ'd about ſome other affair ſo as that they could not either know they prayed to them, or not be at leiſure to attend to them if they did: or becauſe they thought their Gods to be Imperious, that they would be much courted, and long waited upon, and would give their Oratours ſome tediouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and trouble, being <hi>ultimately</hi> pleaſed in ſuch ſigns of ſuperiority above and being honoured by their worſhippers: (whence alſo they might uſe many Titles or Appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their Gods (conjectured by a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man to be the [<gap reason="foreign">

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> would be a very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and minute petitioning. This laſt cauſe ſeems to be intimated from the <hi>8th Verſe</hi> ſubjoyn'd as a reaſon why they ſhould
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:94938:210"/> not uſe vain repetitions (or rather vain and uſeleſs multitudes of words and things whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſame or not) (<hi>viz.) becauſe their heavenly Father knew what things they had need of before they asked him.</hi> The Heathens did not think or know certainly ſo concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Gods, but they believed that they might have need of their Information at leaſt ſometimes. Our Saviour therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits not all long Prayers but only ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity in general; nor all very particular pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioning of God, which is often extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary uſeful, but only to uſe it with the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief that by this means a man might be heard, and that otherwiſe God might know and underſtand his condition, and what in particular he wants, as the Heathens here probably did. This and all the former directions for our ſpeech and geſture as hath been ſuggeſted in ſome of them are but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> and for the greateſt part. Now and then our general prudence whereby we direct all our actions to their laſt end of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God and doing good may ſee good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to depart from them. But this is not only to remember us that there are few, if any, Rules that have not their Exceptions; which moſt men take no notice of till an Objection obligeth them.</p>
                  <p>And thus have I diſpatch'd the firſt ſort of Directions concerning Prayer, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:94938:210"/> ſome conſiderable due Qualifications of Prayer, <hi>1ſt</hi> Of the Things, <hi>2dly</hi> Of the Signs. Of the Things, <hi>1ſt</hi> Of the Objects or Senſe, <hi>2dly</hi> Of the Actions or Operations of Soul in Prayer.</p>
                  <p>I know very well that there are many things in theſe laſt Directions concerning the Signs and Expreſſions of our Senſe and Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of Soul in Prayer which are not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar thereto: but general things of good uſe particularly applied, and which one may never have the opportunity of diſcourſing in their due place may be allowed to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in a particular argument. I ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly juſt obſerve before I mention the ſecond ſort of Directions, that theſe Qualifications of Prayer mentioned will direct us to ſome conſiderable conveniencies and inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Prayers, whereby we may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared in ſome meaſure to determine concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeveral ſorts of Prayers compared, which is to be preferred, and in what reſpects. For Example, whether Prayers compoſed by ſome ſelected out of a National Church for a whole Nation and for an Age or two or more, conſtantly or frequently to be uſed or Publick Forms of Prayers be beſt to be uſed in publick and private; or Prayers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by a private perſon for his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant or frequent uſe, or one each time he hath occaſion called premeditated Prayer
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:94938:211"/> or Prayers left to the felicity of the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Memory, Inſpiration of private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, called <hi>Extempore</hi> Prayers. As if it ſhould be ſaid that generally ſpeaking (for all theſe things have exceptions and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times very numerous ones) in reſpect of the truth, juſtice and importance of the ſenſe in Prayers, and of the beſt conveyance or ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification thereof Publick Prayers are to be preferred: In reſpect of Extenſiveneſs in particulars and conſequently variety, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditated Prayer: In reſpect of the ſincerity in the Reciter and of fervency and ſeaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, premeditated Prayers again. A pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditated Prayer only in reſpect of things and of their order, and not in reſpect of all the words and ſpeech (except one word or ſo as a ſign to the memory for a matter which may take up many ſentences to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs) which may be furniſhed by an habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual memory, ſeems to be better than with every one premeditated word or ſentence. For attending exactly to each word and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and their order takes off the attention from the things, and conſequently our ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able affections even in compoſing the Prayer, but in reciting it by heart much more. The care or attention to thoſe particular expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that they may come to memory and in ſuch an order, cauſe a man leſs to attend to and be affected with the things they ſignifie.
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:94938:211"/> But then this habitual memory of Language muſt be gained by more or leſs uſe and excer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>iſe. If this be not, for want of parts or time or diligence, it is better men ſhould premeditate every word, and keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves thereto, than heſitate, falter, expreſs themſelves improperly, rudely, ſlovenly, childiſhly, or otherwiſe unfitly. But for <hi>Extempore</hi> Prayer in any length (I mean not ſhort Ejaculatory Prayers) the Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in it are ſo much greater and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies ſo much leſs than in Forms or Premeditated Prayers, that I do not ſee it is any where to be uſed where the other can<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as I have before ſaid. Nor is it to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to all even when there is no oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of uſing a Form or Premeditation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but only to perſons who have been and are of great conſideration and judgment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſuch things as are to be the matter of our Prayers, and have well exerciſed themſelves therein, and conſequently are of copious and quick Invention, and Memory of true, juſt, uſeful things, and of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Speech to ſignifie o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>All Conveniencies conſidered, poſſibly a mixture of Publick and Private Forms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of Premeditated Prayers may be beſt, whereby the Inconveniencies in all may be corrected or remedied by each other, and the peculiar Conveniencies of all obtained,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:94938:212"/> eſpecially if there be ſome diſcreet and pious Superiours frequently to take an account of, to hear and direct thoſe who may be leſs ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient when they perform this Duty in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</p>

                  <p>II. I Am now to propound ſome of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſort of Directions, <hi>viz.</hi> How to obtain theſe due Qualifications of Prayer of which I have been diſcourſing, and they be theſe ſix or ſeven among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                  <p>(1.) Read we much and underſtand well the Holy Scriptures that we may apply them truly and uſefully to our own Caſes. The leaſt uſeful to this end (though there are many other excellent uſes) are thoſe Parts which are Controverſial or Hiſtorical, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thoſe which deliver the Actions, but eſpecially the Speeches of Holy Perſons, ſuch as our Saviour's Diſcourſes, amongſt which are ſome Prayers, as our Saviour's and of ſome of the Apoſtles. The moſt uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful are thoſe which are Devotional: ſuch as the Book of <hi>Pſalms,</hi> out of which there are many truly excellent Examples of all the Parts or Ingredients of a Prayer, the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances being rightly underſtood, of
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:94938:212"/> which I have ſtill ſucceſſively made uſe: Alſo thoſe Parts which are Preceptive which contain Inſtructions for our Duty, what our Temper and Spirit, ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Actions and Converſations ought to be, as the Book of <hi>Proverbs,</hi> our Saviour's Diſcourſes, many Chapters of the Epiſtles. I ſay, theſe are more uſeful for this end than thoſe which are controverſial, as moſt part of the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and <hi>Galatians,</hi> &amp;c. though out of theſe too, much may be had. It were to be wiſhed, that with the Scripture there was always ſome ſhort and plain Paraphraſe to be read with it for the better underſtanding of its ſenſe, and that the Sentences thereof which are not plain might not be uſed ignorantly, confuſedly, falſly and erroneouſly. It is very well known, we may think we pray in Scripture when we do not, we may pray with the words of Scripture, but not with the ſenſe. As if praying <hi>that we might not be conformed to this World,</hi> we ſhould mean all other Chriſtians of different perſwaſions from our ſelves, and not the corrupt and ſinful manners of all men whatſoever which was then and is now generally the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mankind in this World. Or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing <hi>our very beſt doings are polluted rags,</hi> we ſhould mean the beſt of the beſt man's actions; and particularly his ſincereſt and
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:94938:213"/> ardenteſt love to God that he can at that time exert (which ſurely may be in one action) were a ſin: and not underſtand it of a Nation generally even in their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous performances, or the beſt of their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons formal, hypocritical, inſincere, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which was the ſenſe of thoſe words when ſpoken, and therefore in ſuch caſe to be uſed, or ſuch like inſtances. Wherefore we ſhould be careful rightly to underſtand and to have the true ſenſe of Scripture, and not through vain imagination, raſhneſs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, ſelf-conceit abuſe the Language thereof: And where the ſenſe is doubtful, and pious, holy and wiſe men differ, rather to abſtain therefrom. We may find elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where expreſſions enough beſides for our ſenſe and meaning.</p>
                  <p>There are abundance of Scripture-Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions very plain and clear in their ſenſe, and need no Paraphraſe or other words for their better underſtanding. As, <hi>that we may live ſoberly, righteouſly, godly in this preſent world; that we may love the Lord our God with all our heart, and our Neighbour as our ſelves; that we might do God's will here on Earth as it is in Heaven; that he would cauſe us to be loving without diſſimulation, merciful with chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to abhor that which is evil, cleave to that which is good, to be kindly affectioned, in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to prefer one another, fervent in Spirit
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:94938:213"/> ſerving the Lord</hi> (thoſe eſpecially whoſe Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice it is to inſtruct in the Knowledge of the Doctrine and Deſign of the Lord Jeſus) <hi>to be rejoycing in hope, patient in tribulation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing inſtant in Prayer</hi> (eſpecially when in the like condition with the perſecuted Chriſtians) <hi>given to hoſpitality, to bleſs them that perſecute,</hi> &amp;c. as that moſt deliciouſly honeſt <hi>Chapter</hi> of <hi>Romans,</hi> the <hi>12th</hi> goes on, and <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. And likewiſe <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 3. and <hi>Gall.</hi> 5. Further, <hi>that God would give us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance unto life, that God would give us for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of our Sins for his Name's ſake, who is the Propitiation for our ſins, and for the ſins of the whole world,</hi> and ſcores the like. But if we uſe any Scripture-Phraſes obſcure and doubtful it is beſt as ſhort and clear as may be at the ſame time to Paraphraſe them, or expreſs them in our moſt known and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore plain Language, as hath been before briefly adviſed. Thus by uſing our ſelves to Read much and rightly underſtand the Scriptures, we ſhall furniſh our ſelves with good ſtore of true, juſt, uſeful and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant matter for our Prayers, though we ought, if we can, to judge what even Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> matter is moſt important and uſeful for us in particular: for there is great difference. Moreover, Scripture-Phraſe thus uſed is ſuch as doth invite to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the ſenſe of what is ſaid by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:94938:214"/> thereof, becauſe ſpoken by Authors for whom we have worthily a great vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and we judge at leaſt directed and overſeen by God himſelf in their ſenſe and expreſſion. Scripture-Phraſes likewiſe which are plain are like to be ſo much the more clear and quickly underſtood, as they are more common and uſed; which is much more than any other.</p>
                  <p>I ſaid juſt now, where Scripture-Phraſes are obſcure, there it will be beſt as ſhortly and as clearly as we can to Paraphraſe them in other Phraſes moſt uſed and therefore beſt known what they ſignifie. As for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, if we ſhould pray in Scripture-Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, that we might be <hi>found in Chriſt,</hi> that we may be <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> that we may <hi>obtain Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. we may add, that we may be ſincere, firm and conſtant believers or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians who may give our ſelves to obey the will of God ſent by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by believing all the Doctrine that he hath taught, and practiſing accordingly; not that we may be in a ſtate of favour with God for Chriſt's ſake; or that by his effectual procurement God would pardon our Sins, acquit us from Puniſhment: which though it be very true and to be pray'd for, yet it is not the ſenſe of thoſe Expreſſions. The ſenſe of <hi>the Churches of</hi> Judea <hi>which were in Chriſt. Galat. 1. Verſe</hi> 22. And <hi>ſalute</hi>
                     <pb n="377" facs="tcp:94938:214"/> Andronicus <hi>and</hi> Junia, <hi>&amp;c. which were in Chriſt before me. Rom.</hi> 16. 7. is; thoſe that were Chriſtians. So alſo if we pray that <hi>Chriſt may be in us,</hi> that he may <hi>dwell in us,</hi> that we may <hi>put on Chriſt or the Lord Jeſus,</hi> add we by way of Paraphraſe and more known Expreſſions, that we may firmly believe Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus to be the Holy One of God, and his Holy Doctrine to be true, that our ſelves may be deeply and conſtantly endued with thoſe moſt excellent qualities of ſuch Knowledge and Holineſs, Wiſdom and Goodneſs, which are the proper Effects of or according to the Doctrine and Example of our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Jeſus Chriſt, which is the ſenſe of <hi>Galat. 3. Verſe 27. As many as have been bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into Chriſt have put on Chriſt,</hi> that is, at leaſt have believed his Doctrine: And of <hi>Rom. 13. Verſe 14. Put ye on the Lord Jeſus.</hi> Hereby alſo, beſides the Sentences, the true ſenſe of thoſe Sentences of Scripture may be conveyed at the ſame time, which was moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what well enough known to whom it was written, but is not yet among us, as it ſeems.</p>
                  <p>So alſo when we make our Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Divine Attributes in Scripture. Sentences in Prayer, let us chooſe rather ſuch as are moſt plain, and therefore moſt proper, or as little figurative as may be. As, <hi>Thou that knoweſt the hearts of all men,</hi>
                     <pb n="378" facs="tcp:94938:215"/> (Acts 2.) <hi>the ſearcher of hearts and tryer of reins. Thou art God which haſt made Heaven and Earth,</hi> &amp;c. (Acts 4.) <hi>Great is the Lord and greatly to be praiſed, and his greatneſs is unſearchable. That the Heaven of Heavens cannot contain him. That the Lord is gracious, full of compaſſion, ſlow to anger and of great mercy, good to all, and his tender mercies over all his works. Pſalm</hi> 145. That he is our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father, the only true God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

                     </gap> after the likeneſs of men it may be beſt to add at leaſt ſometimes ſome proper word or phraſe for explication and prevention of miſtake, eſpecially in vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar apprehenſion. For Example, if we ſhould ſay <hi>Thy Throne, O Lord, is in Heaven, thy eyes behold, thy eye-lids try the children of men. Pſalm 11. Verſe</hi> 4. it may follow, In Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven are the moſt excellent manifeſtations of thy preſence, of thy greatneſs and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: yet thou moſt exactly knoweſt all things here upon Earth and whatſoever is in man. If we ſhould ſay, <hi>Thou, Lord, lookeſt from Heaven and beholdeſt all the ſons of men, from the place of thy habitation thou lookeſt upon all the Inhabitants of the Earth. Pſalm 33. Verſe</hi> 13. we may add theſe or other more fit Expreſſions according to the Auditory; Thy Power and Knowledge, thy Providence
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:94938:215"/> is extended from Heaven to Earth, that is, every where. To thee, the effects of whoſe power, wiſdom and goodneſs are the moſt perfect and great in the heavenly Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is alſo perfectly known whatſoever is here upon this Earth. When we ſay, <hi>God is angry with the wicked and loveth the righteous;</hi> we may add puniſheth the one and willeth and doth good to the other. The Expreſſions of <hi>The Lord is full of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion</hi> and <hi>ſlow to anger</hi> may be followed with, <hi>The Lord doth plentifully and frequently relieve the miſerable, diſtreſſed, afflicted, and delayeth or forbeareth to puniſh ſinners.</hi> It is a very true and uſeful Rule in Divinity, that thoſe Expreſſions in Scripture which proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſignifie Humane Paſſions applied to God they ſignifie only the Effects of ſuch Paſſions. I do not think but that the learned &amp; unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but eſpecially the laſt often groſly enough and falſly conceive God with Humane Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, place and other imperfections. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the frequent uſe of ſuch proper Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions will make it more eaſie to conceive the true ſpiritual and perfect Nature of God.</p>

                  <p>(2.) I Adviſe thoſe who are capable thereof to Contemplation, Conſideration, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, that they may find out and obſerve particularly what may be fit and proper matter for each of the parts of Prayer before mentioned; that they may judge and be ſatisfied concerning the truth and uſefulneſs of each thing; when it is uſeful and when it is moſt ſo, or its ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs; that they might alſo often reflect upon and obſerve the intention, purpoſe and end they have in their Prayers, purifie their hearts from all inſincerity and hypocriſie, that they may quicken and ſtir up in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves thoſe affections or inclinations which are fit and proper according as they ſee the truth and uſefulneſs of things, upbraiding and reproaching themſelves with an unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable dulneſs and inſenſibleneſs of thoſe things which they ought to be and are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being more affected withal.</p>
                  <p>If any of us have time or ability uſe we it to meditate upon God, his Nature, his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, his Actions, as long and as parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly as we can, to conſider, to judge, to examine what he <hi>truly and really</hi> is and doth, and accordingly to ſtir up our affections and
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:94938:216"/> inclinations of Admiration, Honour, Love, Deſire, Fear, Faith and Hope, Obedience, Submiſſion and Self-reſignation. In Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Thankſgiving and Petition, the thing is yet more eaſie, and in ſome meaſure may be done by the ignoranteſt and weakeſt. For who cannot, if he would, take ſome time to look back upon his life, upon what he hath done in his Youth in his riper age, when in this or that or t'other place, Condition, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or Employment, what was well, what was ill done by him; where he was inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and ſincere, where not; what he hath been or done the laſt year or week or day? who cannot enter into account and call to mind the common Bleſſings that he and others do conſtantly receive from God, and moreover particularly many favours ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, of good Inſtructions, wiſe, pious, wholeſome Counſel and Adviſe, good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample from his Miniſter or his Friends, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and Neighbours, many good ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and motions of Conſcience that have kept him from wickedneſs, or put him on to what was good; temporal ones alſo of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, health, deliverance, plenty or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency, or at leaſt ſome degree of Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this Life? who is there that cannot reflect upon God's goodneſs in forbearance, when he hath reflected upon his ſins, and the gracious offers and aſſurances of his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:94938:217"/> and forgiveneſs for Chriſt's ſake upon his true repentance and inward habitual change and amendment of temper and life, and conſequently of Heaven and a happier Life after we here expire and leave this earthly body? And ſo in like manner for Petition, the meaneſt perſon ſurely may in a very little time learn to know much of what he would have, and what he ought to have. If any one ſhould give the meaneſt and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noranteſt perſon notice to let him know what he wanted and what he would have, yet nothing but what was honeſt and juſt for him to ask, promiſing him withal a full ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, I ſuppoſe one ſhould ſoon have a good long Petition. And if thou canſt tell a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable and wiſe man what thou wouldſt have, and thou thinkeſt juſtly, canſt thou not tell God? haſt thou nothing to ſay to him or deſire of him? who cannot alſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what conſider whether what he asks of God be honeſt and juſt, and at laſt refer all freely without grudging to the wiſdom and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, as humble and well condition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Beggars ſhould do? nay, in ſpiritual things the meaneſt perſon may with ſome thought know much what to ask. Is it ſo hard for one to take notice of what Sin or Luſt he hath been guilty of the laſt week or day, and to what he is prone, and from what he cannot abſtain without much difficulty, or
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:94938:217"/> is careleſs whether he doth or no? Is it ſo hard for a perſon to know whether he hath been guilty of or prone to Prophaneſs, Neglect of God, Swearing and Forſwearing, fooliſh, raſh, falſe and fraudulent Affirmations and Oaths, to Malice, Hatred, Revenge, Wrath, Pride, Vain-glory, Contention, Brawling, Reviling, Slander, Drunkenneſs, Luſt or any other Senſuality? When he knows it, behold matter for his Prayer. This may be done before ſecret Prayer, and upon ſolemn occaſions eſpecially. As for others either Sins or Wants, and conſequently in Prayers with others, it is not ſo eaſie to obſerve and mention them with prudence, but thoſe who can may make uſe of their Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here alſo. It is eaſie for any one to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand how this Conſideration and Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction tends to the furniſhing of our minds more or leſs, according as we can make uſe of it, with matter for our Prayers, and that very particular true, juſt, important; as alſo how it tends to make us ſincere, real and ſerious, more fervent, more eaſily frequent and ſeaſonable in our Prayers. And ſo alſo if we be to pray with others we may conſider of our words or ſpeech and geſture, what are ſuch as I have deſcribed, and what are contrary thereto. And the more we do conſider of ſuch things, the better we are like to uſe them. And the want of this is one cauſe why there is and
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:94938:218"/> hath been ſo many miſerable defects in the due Qualifications mentioned, and in others, in the performance of this Duty; why Prayers both alone and with others have been ſo full of what's falſe, unjuſt, abſurd and unreaſonable for God to give, trifling and of little uſe, barren and contracted, or vainly repeated, ſo full of hypocriſie and inſincerity, of coldneſs and formality, of impertinency and unſeaſonableneſs, of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſive expreſſions and deportments, of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity, ſuperfluity and Tautology. Men have been put or have put themſelves upon the frequent performance of them by their own Invention and compoſing without any conſideration or other general ſufficient In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction before at any time in their lives, much leſs before each particular Prayer; and ſome few perſons who could have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed this Duty, eſpecially with others, pretty well themſelves, have not conſidered how few there have been that could do likewiſe. There are two extremes in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious performances to be avoided, the one which judgeth people generally to be of leſs ability and capacity than they are, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly allows them leſs liberty than ought to be: and another which judgeth them to be of greater capacity, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore allows them too much. Of the one the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> are notoriouſly guilty, of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:94938:218"/> all or moſt of thoſe Sects which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt againſt and ſeparate from National or more publick and large Churches: of which the reaſon is obvious.</p>

                  <p>(3.) MAke uſe of other mens Prayers, that is, compoſed by them. Let us ſerve our ſelves of others la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and pains in this kind. Do not either through lazineſs, neglect, or through ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceit, vain-glory, affectation to do all thy ſelf, though far worſe than if thou hadſt followed or imitated another, diſdain to make uſe of this help and means. And this whether the Prayers thou mayſt make uſe of be pronounced only or written; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they may be heard only by thee, (ſuch as are thoſe which are recited in Publick by Miniſters and Preachers, or by others whoſe Examples are conſiderable, in private;) Or they may be read alſo, ſuch as are the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Prayers which are or may be compo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ed by the Church, or ſuch as are on purpoſe compoſed for Families and for Cloſets, or for private and ſecret. Theſe laſt <hi>which are to be read</hi> more eſpecially chooſe we for our uſe as being invented and compoſed with more care, attention and choice, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:94938:219"/> the more likely to have all thoſe due Qualifications mentioned, which written or printed things can have. Here alſo chooſe by the advice of the moſt knowing perſons thoſe which are written by the moſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and diſcreet unprejudiced and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial, pious and godly perſons. For the uſe of theſe means or helps it may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſable to commend to moſt perſons theſe four ſteps according to perſons abilities or leiſure and time.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Make uſe altogether of ſome Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers compoſed by others, and of variety of them; as for Morning, for Evening, for the Lord's day before and after the Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, for the Lord's Supper before and after it, for Faſting Times, or Times of Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving either for publick or private Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or Favours, in caſe of Sickneſs or Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, in caſe of Deliverance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> let theſe be thy entire Prayers. Hereby it is moſt likely Perſons will be far better furniſhed than they can from themſelves, with things that are true, juſt, important and of greateſt moment even to them, and with conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able variety too, with the moſt general and comprehenſive things: They will find here quickning and ſtirring Examples of Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, of Fervency: They will alſo be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed with the beſt Speech and Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:94938:219"/> both of Senſe and Affections, of Things and Operations of Soul, the moſt proper, uſual and clear ones, and with ſuch profitable variety thereof as I have heretofore men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. Thoſe who cannot read (the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of which will be every day fewer, I hope) let them get to recite ſome ſhort Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers by Memory, firſt having learnt them from their Parents or others. Such as the Lord's Prayer with the Explication of it and the ſum of the Ten Commandments in the Church-Catechiſm turn'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nto a Prayer, and other ſhort comprehenſive Forms more or fewer according to their Ability; and let Parents be careful to teach their Children ſuch as theſe before, it may be, they can read; and when they can read direct them to ſome of the beſt, and ſee they ſay them. Though thou prayeſt thus out of a Book yet if thou prayeſt becauſe thou judgeſt the things true, juſt, neceſſary and of great Importance to thee, and thou prayeſt with a ſincere Heart that thou mayſt receive good things from God to pleaſe and ſerve him withal, to do all good to others, to be the moſt profitable and beneficial to the World by thy Tempor, Life and Actions, eſpecially in Spiritual things if thou canſt, to be perfect and happy thy ſelf here and hereafter. If thou prayeſt with a fervent Spirit according to the goodneſs of things: thou prayeſt every
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:94938:220"/> whit as well as if thou hadſt invented all thy ſelf; and poſſibly a hundred times better than many conceited Perſons but ignorant and vain-glorious do; whoſe Prayers of their own compoſing may be ſtuffed with untrue, unjuſt, and trifling things, and either they are cold and formal in them or elſe much hypocritical or ſuperſtitious; that is, either they have the ſigns of great Affections to things, when they have not thoſe Affections really in them at all, or not ſo much out of a judgment and ſenſe that things do deſerve them, as out of vain-glory. Or their great Affections are to trifling things. Men have been apt to attempt to run and fly too, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could go; to attempt greater things before they could do leſs; to attempt to do things before they were furniſhed with ſuch Qualities, which if they wanted they had better not do them at all, or might have done them much better another way than that which they uſed. This is the firſt ſtep, and may be uſed for ſome time only, if we find our ſelves ſufficient (and let it not be careleſsneſs and ſluggiſhneſs that we are not) to advance further. This is no other than what all beginners to learn do: They firſt read good Authors more or leſs who treat concerning the Matter they would learn.</p>
                  <p>The Second Step may be for Perſons to
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:94938:220"/> take Parts of ſeveral Prayers and to attempt to put them together and compoſe them, and then commit them to Memory. To take ſuch things out of them which they beſt underſtand and apprehend by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or otherwiſe; which they think moſt proper and uſeful for them for their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, Employment, or Calling; which they may be moſt affected withal. Thus they may begin to uſe and exerciſe their own judgment in what things are beſt, and what is beſt for them; always with an humble and modeſt mind ready to be more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
                  <p>A Third Step may be to add and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſomething of their own Invention or Obſervation, eſpecially if there be any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Occaſion. As for Example, If thou ſhouldſt find any Sin or Luſt more trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to thee, and be more in danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing overcome thereby; if thou ſhouldſt fear any particular approaching Evil or be under it, either thou or thy Family; If thou ſhouldſt be ſo happy as to have overcome any Temptation, or to have received any eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Favour; If thou ſhouldſt find thy ſelf upon ſome ſpecial occaſion very ſenſible of ſome Attribute of God, as his Goodneſs, his Power, his Omniſcience, his Juſtice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thou needeſt not ſtay till thou findeſt the
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:94938:221"/> Thing or the Expreſſion in thy Book. In order hereto therefore uſe thy ſelf before thy Prayers to reflect and conſider. This which I now ſay principally concerns ſecret Prayer, where it may be done more freely, though it be imper<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ectly and brokenly ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conceived or expreſſed.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly and laſtly, Proceed to Imitation of others as much as thou canſt; that is, to conſider, invent, examine, and judge the Matter or Senſe of thy Prayers thy ſelf, what things are the moſt important, great, juſt, true, uſeful for thee, and to affect thy ſelf accordingly, and to expreſs and ſignifie them well, and ſo to compoſe and make en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire ones of thine own. Which may be often varied by inſiſting now upon one, now upon other things, according to ſome Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices I have heretofore given; that is, what things may be the moſt ſeaſonable, beſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, moſt affecting. I could heartily wiſh all Mens Abilities and Employments were ſuch, that they might do more in this kind and imitate and exceed the beſt Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns. I wiſh to that End they were more ſpiritual in the Employment of their Thoughts and Affections, and that there were no fault in their wills that they are not ſo. I wiſh they might make uſe of what Time and Ability they have, and ought
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:94938:221"/> ſo to uſe. I wiſh they had more of thoſe Qualities which may fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> them for the beſt Performances thereof, the principal of which are as of all others, Charity and Humility. Finally, <hi>Would God that all the Lord's People were Prophets, and that the Lord would put h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>(4.) PRay we to God ſometimes, that he would help and aſſiſt us to pray as we ought, to have more of all thoſe due Qualifications, whereby we are fitted to pray well. This Prayer it ſelf ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth ſome already, for that once, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>o often as we make it, which may be often Ejaculatory. Whatever kind of Prayer we think beſt and we deſire to uſe, there may be ſome or other of the fore-named Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications which may be prayed for. As if one ſhould pray a Prayer compoſed by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he might pra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> that God would give him Sincerity and Fervency in that his Prayer; that God would keep him from Vain-glory, Formality, Coldneſs, that he might do it in all ſincerity of Heart as his Duty to God, and to make and keep him good, and that he might be enabled and diſpoſed both by the Performance of the
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:94938:222"/> Duty it ſelf, and by the good things he ſhall receive upon his asking to ſerve God by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good; That he might not only have Words in his Tongue, and be upon his Knees or any other Poſture ſignifying De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, but that he might alſo well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and mind and attend to what he ſays with his Mouth, and have proportionable degrees of Affection and Motion of Soul, of Honour, Love, Reverence, Faith, Joy, Deſire, Reſignation and Submiſſion towards Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, of Grief for and Deteſtation of Sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Thankfulneſs for Benefits received, of ardent Deſires for Holineſs and Virtue eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially; and hearty ones for all other good things. Nay, a man may pray for Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency, that is, that God would excite and diſpoſe his Mind to pray in Secret and Private as often as he hath Opportunity, that he might not be ſo backward and averſe therefrom, ſo dull and inept thereto, and that God would give him more Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, if it ſhould happen he ſhould want them. I ſay theſe things a Man may pray for, though he always prayed a Form, and he could not pray, that what he prayed might be juſt, true, important, ſeaſonable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe all this was done already, and the matter was ſuppoſed to be ſuch or elſe it would not be made uſe of.</p>
                  <p>But in the other Steps of Prayer if a
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:94938:222"/> Man finds he can or ought to aſcend to them (ſuch as compoſing out of more Prayers, or out of his own Obſervation and Invention) he may pray for the other Qualifications alſo, as that God would excite him to uſe the Means forementioned of Reading, Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating, Hearing or otherwiſe to pray what was true, juſt, important with Sincerity, Fervency, prudent Seaſonableneſs, and to expreſs and ſignifie theſe things (if he be to pray with others) moſt aptly and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that God would keep him from Errour and Miſtake, Superſtition, Dulneſs, Inſincerity, Formality, Coldneſs; That God would help his Invention, Attention, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Memory both in Things and Words proper for Prayer; That he might more particularly know God's Attributes, his own Sins, God's Mercies, his own Wants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When we pray for theſe due Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our Prayers, let us be ſure that we pray for the beſt of them firſt and moſt. For Example, More for the Truth, Juſtice, Importance, as alſo for Sincerity, Fervency, and prudent ſeaſonableneſs of what we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in our Prayers; than for Multitude or Variety, Celerity or Volubility. More alſo for Senſe and Affection; than for the ſigns of them, Speech and Geſture, or more for good Underſtanding and Affection, than for Utterance and Eloquence. To have the
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:94938:223"/> aforeſaid habitual Qualifications for Prayer, is that which is called in ſome Mens, and in Scripture-Phraſe, <hi>the Spirit of Prayer:</hi> Of which therefore we ſee he hath the beſt Part who hath the beſt Qualifications, and he the moſt, who hath the moſt. He who prays true, juſt and important, ſolidly uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things with Sincerity, juſt and due Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency, Frequency and Seaſonableneſs, though they are but very few and ſhort, hath more of the Spirit of Prayer; than he that hath in his Prayers great Variety indeed of Matter and Words; but it is what is falſe or uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, unjuſt, ſmall, trivial, or with Inſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, Vain-glory formality; or he whoſe Heat and Fervency is only bodily Paſſion raiſed up by Motion and Agitation of his Body, Lungs, Organs of Speech, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Not to excellent uſeful things becauſe ſeen and perceived ſo, nor felt by any natural antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patory ſenſe in innocent Souls, nor by the Spirit of God. Of which one certain ſign is when things are untrue, unjuſt, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial. Theſe, I ſay, are ſigns that the Heat, the very corporeal Affections of the Soul come not from underſtanding natural Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions or the Spirit of God, but from ſome other Cauſe and that is uſually the natural or affected Motions of the Body.</p>
                  <p>I ſee not but we may as well expect to have our Prayers heard in theſe things, and
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:94938:223"/> to receive them, as in others: nay, in ſome of them the moſt of all: ſuch as are the Truth, Juſtice, Importance of our Deſires, our Sincerity, and proportionable Fervency of Spirit. We cannot make a more accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Prayer to God than for ſuch Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as theſe; The other of Variety, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularity of things but eſpecially of Words and Expreſſions being much leſs uſeful and conſiderable, and this eſpecially if we be private Perſons and the leſs it is our Office to pray with others. In the Uſe of theſe Means it is we are principally to expect that God Almighty will by his immediate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, by his Holy Spirit help us to pray well. If we ſet our ſelves to read the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and other good Books, to conſider, examine, meditate, reflect, to pray to him, he may (though we cannot tell when or how much) ſuggeſt to and illuminate our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, and which is beſt of all excite holy Affections and Inclinations. It is not likely to be juſt before we are going to pray, or in Prayers, when we have been careleſs, but yet by either the natural Temper of our Bodys, or by our own ſtraining, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citations or Endeavours, our Invention and Memory are much better than we expected. Nor indeed ſeems it to be ſo much matter which way God helps and aſſiſts us to pray as
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:94938:224"/> we ought, whether mediately by means or immediately ſo it be done.</p>

                  <p>(5.) I Add that our Prayers (for we may pray ſincerely for a greater Degree or for conſtancy of Sincerity it ſelf) for all theſe due Qualifications may be ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful, let us be ſure to be ſincere hearted, deſirous and ready to uſe all that God ſhall beſtow upon us to ſerve him by doing good: And eſpecially in this Caſe if God ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon us this Spirit and Gift of Prayer more or leſs, that we be humble and modeſt, and that we do not think of our ſelves above what we ought, not think our ſelves to have more than we have, nor to neglect and take no notice of God the Giver; as if we had what we have from our ſelves; That we be not vain-glorious contemptuous of others, pleaſing our ſelves <hi>abſolutely</hi> in our own Superiority to them: But that we mortifie and extinguiſh all ſuch vile Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, Affections, and Luſts of the Fleſh, or degenerate and ſinful Nature: And that we humbly acknowledge God the Authour of what we have and are, be it more or leſs; that we have a right and due Eſtimation of
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:94938:224"/> it: That we remember very well like and highly approve of it, that we and all we have is given us, not for our ſelves only to pleaſe our ſelves; but to pleaſe God by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good with them. Theſe are the likely Capacities to receive theſe things of God: Theſe render us the moſt fit ſubjects for God's Suggeſtions, Inſtructions, Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Excitation of holy Affections for all Divine things, and indeed for all other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. <hi>The Meek will he guide in Judgment, and the Meek will he teach his Way.</hi> Pſalm 25.

                  <p>(7.) WHich indeed ſhould have been in the firſt Place being the moſt general, be not content and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with any Prayers. Some there are in which are many things falſe, ſome in which are many Petitions and Deſires from God very juſt; and yet with a ſtrange Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Confidence, as if Men would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to God, or that they always knew certainly what he ought to do, and what he therefore will do, in things which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they nor any other Man can have much certainty without Divine Revelation: nay, ſometimes in things where the contrary to what they deſire ſeems moſt likely to others beſides themſelves to be juſt, and therefore fit for God to grant. As when one Party prays for Succeſs in his or his Party's Cauſe, for Victory or Superiority; When a Man prays that God would defend and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate his Truth, meaning ſome certain Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:94938:225"/> of his own which may be falſe and hurtful. All which generally comes from Pride and Self-conceit. Mortals are very apt to think they oblige the Divinity by the honour they do it by their Prayers to grant them what they deſire. The <hi>Jews</hi> at this day think and ſay that God cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand their Prayers. It hath been ſaid, I doubt, but too often vainly and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly, that God could not hold out againſt a <hi>praying People.</hi> But too well known hath been the confidence of many private perſons that their Prayers ſhould be anſwered; and as well known hath been their diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment.</p>
                  <p>Many Prayers alſo may be ſtuffed with things very trivial and ſlight comparatively, while the greater things are neglected: ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler ſins, and other ſins may be confeſſed ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly, but greater, and their own not taken notice of or but ſlightly. Petitions may be made for Worldly things importunately, but for Spiritual negligently or coldly. We may pray for Gifts or excellent Qualities of Underſtanding more than for Graces or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Diſpoſitions of Will: For Pardon more than for Goodneſs; For Priviledges more than for Dutys; For Juſtification more than for Sanctification: For Peace and Aſſurance before and more than for Regeneration, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newal of our Natures, Mortification of our
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:94938:226"/> Luſts, Love to God for his Excellencies, Charity, Humility, Spirituality. In Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers alſo may be very much Inſincerity, the things deſired may be ſelfiſh, to gratifie im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate Luſts of Revenge, Pride, Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority, Envy, Covetouſneſs, Senſuality, Luxury or the like. Some Prayers (I wiſh I could not ſay moſt) may be very cold, formal, meer words.</p>
                  <p>Be not, I ſay, very well ſatisfied ſo thou haſt but prayed, though it may be very bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Endeavour not only to pray, but pray well and as thou oughteſt, and therefore make uſe of ſuch Means and Directions as have been preſcribed.</p>
                  <p>I add here too as an uſeful Caution by the by, Be not content and ſatisfied with thy having prayed well. If thy Prayers have been ſuch as have proceeded from good Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities in thee, and tend to make thee more ſo too, and thou feeleſt thy ſelf very much delighted with the Performance thereof, and much diſpoſed thereby to the Univerſal Practice of thy Duty; think not that thou haſt been good enough at the time of thy Prayers, and mayſt be negligent every where elſe. In all thy ſucceeding Actions purſue thy good Diſpoſition begun by thy Prayers at any time, by Watchfulneſs and Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the following day, by frequent Checks when thou doeſt ill, and Encouragements

                  <p>VI. THe laſt General Head was the Excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes or Pretences Men uſually make why they do not Pray eſpecially in Private or Secret, in which I ſhall be but ſhort. They are moſt commonly but theſe three: (1.) That they need not Pray. (2.) They have not Ability to Pray. (3.) They have not Time.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Pretence ſome Men have for not praying is, that there is no need of it, it is to no purpoſe, and that therefore it is a fooliſh thing. The Reaſon of which their Opinion is either becauſe they think there is no God at all, nor any Being ſuperior to themſelves in Power, Wiſdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:94938:227"/> who hears them when they do pray: or elſe becauſe all future things are willed and determined by God already, and that he is unchangeable.</p>
                  <p>As to the firſt of theſe Reaſons, if it were true it would render all Prayers and all things contained in them ridiculous indeed. But I ſhall return no other Anſwer to theſe Monſters of Inſolency and Dulneſs, but that though they hereby call all Mankind (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept one or two of themſelves if there be any) Sots and Fools in ſpending ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable a part of their time: yet the World will have better Demonſtrations (and they ought to be no leſs againſt ſo Univerſal a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony) than ever they have brought to prove them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o, before they will believe it; or before theſe Objectors themſelves ought to believe it. Moreover, there have been in this laſt Age ſuch and ſo many Proofs of God's and Spirits Exiſtence both highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, and ſome abſolutely neceſſary as I have upon the longeſt conſideration judged, that it is nothing but an obſtinate Affection of Uncontroulableneſs and Licentiouſneſs in thoſe who do or may know them, or a piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able dulneſs which muſt make them capable of a contrary perſwaſion.</p>
                  <p>As to the Second Reaſon, of God's prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of all things, It muſt mean more particularly one of theſe two things:</p>
                  <pb n="403" facs="tcp:94938:227"/>
                  <p>Firſt, That it is needleſs <hi>to ſet our ſelves to Pray,</hi> (meaning all Ingredients of a Prayer) becauſe it is predetermined by God whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ſhall or no.</p>
                  <p>Or elſe, Secondly, That it is needleſs <hi>to Pray to God for any good thing,</hi> (meaning by Prayer <hi>Petition</hi> only) becauſe he hath prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined whether we ſhall have the thing we pray for or no.</p>
                  <p>To the Firſt of theſe it is to be anſwered, That there is the ſame reaſon againſt all will, endeavor, action whatſoever to obtain any good thing we want: For Example, Againſt the chewing and ſwallowing our Food that we may be nouriſhed. For the Argument runs thus. God hath determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before we pray whether we ſhall pray or not. If the firſt, then we ſhall do it without our will or endeavor: If the ſecond, then we ſhall not do it with them. In the ſame manner we may argue: God hath determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before we chew and ſwallow our Food to nouriſh us, whether we ſhall do thoſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or no. If the firſt, we ſhall do them without our will and endeavour; if the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, we ſhall not though we do will and endeavour to do them. But we do not ſee men in this and the like caſes abſtain from their will and endeavor for ſuch a Reaſon though it be ſuggeſted to them. But they always uſe both, where they believe them
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:94938:228"/> to be the cauſe or condition of their obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any good thing they deſire.</p>
                  <p>And indeed they have the greateſt reaſon ſo to do, which is a Second thing to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. For (briefly and not to ſpend much time here in theſe ſubtilties) ſince men muſt of neceſſity <hi>will and endeavour,</hi> after ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing or not (whether it be or be not prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined they ſhall will and endeavour or not) there being no middle: ſurely it is moſt manifeſt that they are to take that part of which there appears to them the beſt Effects and conſequences: but it is as manifeſt that there doth appear better effects and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of <hi>willing and endeavouring</hi> after that which is the cauſe or caution of any good thing, than of omitting ſo to do or lying idle becauſe God hath predetermined we know not which of the two, (<hi>viz.</hi>) ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ſhall <hi>will and endeavor</hi> or not. But this is not the ordinary ſenſe of this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on here, though it be in a controverſie which hath filled many Volumes.</p>
                  <p>To the Second therefore, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is needleſs to petition God for any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath predetermined whether we ſhall have it or no, many things may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed. As,</p>
                  <p>(1.) Let it be obſerved, That this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on lyeth only againſt that part of <hi>a Prayer,</hi> which is called <hi>Petition:</hi> but not againſt the
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:94938:228"/> other, which we have often mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> Acknowledgment of God's Perfections with ſutable Affections, Thankſgiving, Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Profeſſion and Reſolution of Obedience, Explication of our Wants. All which have many excellent uſes, beſides their ſubſerviency to Petition; as hath been before particularly ſhewn.</p>
                  <p>(2.) May be replied, That which hath been juſt now ſaid, <hi>viz.</hi> That the ſame Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument will hold at leaſt againſt the uſe of all means to obtain any good which we do not ſee to have a neceſſary and inſeparable connexion with their end. To repeat it very briefly. God hath praedetermined, that we ſhall or ſhall not have the thing we Petition or Pray for: If the firſt, we ſhall have it without praying: If the ſecond, we ſhall not have it with praying. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner God hath praedetermined we ſhall or ſhall not be nouriſhed: If the firſt, we ſhall be nouriſhed without our chewing or ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Food: If the ſecond, we ſhall not be nouriſhed with them. Wherefore chew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſwallowing our Food is a needleſs and ſuperfluous thing, and conſequently to be omitted. But men neither do nor ought to infer and practiſe thus in this laſt Caſe, for the reaſon which hath been in the firſt ſenſe of this Objection and for another which ſhall be preſently mentioned: and
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:94938:229"/> therefore they ought not to do it in the firſt. And in very truth they are ſome other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed cauſes which keep men from praying when this of God's praedetermination is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. <hi>viz.</hi> Either wickedneſs or inept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſpiritual things, either badneſs or <hi>materiality</hi> of mind, if it may be ſo called.</p>
                  <p>(3.) I anſwer, That ſuppoſing the opinion of God's abſolute praedetermination of all things and the inference too: <hi>viz.</hi> That nothing is granted us upon the condition of our duly qualified Prayers, ſhould ſeem to us more probable: yet ſuppoſing alſo the contrary Opinion, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>God doth not ſo predetermine all things as not to give ſome good things upon the condition of our Prayers,</hi> to appear to us of many excellent uſes and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in the World; we ought to be ſo much the leſs averſe from or more inclined to the belief of it. But ſuppoſing both the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions to appear to us equally uncertain or probable, we ought, I think, in this and every other ſuch caſe to believe and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly practice on that ſide which hath appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently the beſt conſequences or is of moſt good effect. But the belief of our recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving things from God upon our due Prayers and the conſequent practiſe is of infinite bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conſequence to the World than the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the contrary, and conſequently the leaving quite off to pray at all. Such are
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:94938:229"/> the frequent occaſions of bringing God to our minds, the ſenſe of our entire depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon him; the conſtant remembrance of and attention to the only condition of ſo great a favor from him as the granting our Petitions; <hi>viz.</hi> Happineſs, a diſpoſed Soul to uſe all things to ſerve and pleaſe him with, and to do all the good we can; or Piety and Charity; and therefore how dear and acceptable to him ſuch qualities of Soul are; whence we ſhall be the moſt ſtrongly engaged to adorn our Souls with them, that we may be well pleaſing in his ſight and capable of all inſtances of his favor.</p>
                  <p>(4.) I anſwer, That it ſeems to our very ſhort reaſon and imperfect comprehenſion of things to be the beſt Syſtem of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe (that is, that there is the greateſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs as to extenſion, intenſion and dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reſulting there from) that ſome things ſhould be done by God upon condition of the certain uſe of our liberty or faculty of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determination, and particularly, the giving us ſome good things upon our applying our ſelves duly to requeſt them at his hands: and that therefore it is more probable to be ſo. Of which I ſay no more in this place.</p>
                  <p>(5.) And laſtly, To take away all cavel and ſatisfie all ſcruple and doubt to them
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:94938:230"/> who believe the Holy Scripture, I anſwer, that it is therein expreſly affirmed, that our due Petitions are ſuch conditions of God's giving us good things with which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at leaſt he will, and without which he will not give them to us. Some things he will always certainly give us upon our due Prayers. Such as <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Pardon:</hi> or inward ſtrength in ſome degree or other to repent and become good, and forgiveneſs of our paſt ſins when we do repent. Other things alſo he will certainly give us upon the ſame condition of our Prayers, though we do not know certainly (very probably we may) which nor when. Becauſe we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell neither by Reaſon nor Revelation whether it be juſt or conſiſtent with the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Good that he ſhould.</p>
                  <p>Nothing can be more plain than that of our Saviour. <hi>Luke 11. 9, 10. I ſay unto you ask and it ſhall be given to you, ſeek and ye ſhall find, knock and it ſhall be opened unto you. For every one that asketh receiveth, and he that ſeeketh findeth, and to him that knocketh it ſhall be opened.</hi> And in the <hi>8th Verſe</hi> it is taught us by ſimilitude, that God will not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times give without our <hi>importunity</hi> in ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but with it he will. <hi>I ſay unto you, Though he</hi> (his friend) <hi>will not riſe and give him becauſe he is his friend: yet becauſe of his importunity, he will riſe and give him as many
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:94938:230"/> as he needeth.</hi> St. <hi>James</hi> telleth the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, to whom he wrote, <hi>that they did fight and war, (i. e.</hi> probably they uſed violent endeavors and that by contention and ſtrife to obtain things) <hi>and yet had not, becauſe they did not ask.</hi> Nay, <hi>they asked and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not becauſe they asked amiſs.</hi> James 4. Ver. 2, 3.</p>
                  <p>This fully anſwereth the Objection by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the Conſequence of the Argument. For it doth not follow, that becauſe God hath praedetermined that we ſhall have any thing, therefore we ſhall have it without our Prayer: but on the contrary it is moſt certain from theſe and other places of the Holy Scripture, as it is highly probable by reaſon; that whether God hath or hath not praedetermined we ſhall have ſome things; he hath determined that with our Prayer we ſhall, and without our Prayer we ſhall not have them. It is certain, that he hath determined the <hi>connexion</hi> of our <hi>having</hi> and <hi>praying</hi> whenſoever they are: whether he hath determined our <hi>having</hi> and our <hi>praying</hi> or not.</p>
                  <p>But we ſhall make uſe of this Anſwer further, to prove that it is a <hi>perfection</hi> in us or <hi>a good uſe of our ſelves</hi> to pray or deſire things from God. For if we do at all <hi>will</hi> any action or omiſſion of any action, to do this or that or not to do it, whether this
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:94938:231"/> our <hi>willing</hi> be praedetermined or not; it is moſt certainly the perfection or beſt uſe thereof (as hath been before intimated) <hi>to will</hi> that of which there appears to us the beſt conſequences and effects: but it is as certain from the Scripture and Reaſon too that there are better conſequences of <hi>willing</hi> to pray and of <hi>praying</hi> or deſiring things from God, than of <hi>omitting</hi> or neglecting it: and particularly beſides thoſe many other excellent ones a little before mentioned, the receiving of many good things for our ſelves and ſome the beſt we are capable of. Better conſequences than theſe I am ſure the neglect or omiſſion of petitioning God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo much as pretend to. Nay, hence alſo it further ſtill follows, that if we have any liberty or faculty of ſelf-determination it is not only our <hi>perfection</hi> to pray, but alſo our <hi>obligation</hi> (ſuch is my ſenſe of that word.) For certainly we are bound to will and chuſe that which is our <hi>perfection,</hi> if we do not ſee it inconſiſtent with a greater good, as ſurely we do not ſee this to be. And thus much for the Firſt Pretence.</p>

                  <p>(2.) A Second Pretence men make uſe of, is want of Ability to Pray. Alas! they for their part are very igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of and not able to diſcern the truth, juſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ce, importance of the matter of their Prayers; they know very little; they are ignorant of the Nature and Attributes of God; they know or can remember very little of their own hearts and actions, what are and what are not ſins, and of what they have been or are guilty. And as little ſtill are they able to know and call to mind the particular Favours and Benefits they have received, or the things they want or ſhould deſire, eſpecially ſpiritual ones. They want Prudence to attend to what is ſeaſonable. Moreover, they are dull and heavy and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ept to apprehend, attend to, be affected with ſuch things. Finally, they want Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, Memory, Judgment, Affection for God, their Sins, their Mercies, their Wants; and moſt of all do they want Invention and Memory for fit Words and Speech. Alas, how ſhould they know to expreſs themſelves well? Sometimes they have good things in their mind but they cannot ſpeak them. To
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:94938:232"/> this Effect is their Second Excuſe. To which I Anſwer:</p>
                  <p>(1.) All this, except that of want of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion and Affection is no juſt Excuſe for not joyning with others in Prayers either in Publick or Private; it is no Excuſe for not being at Prayers and coming to them. For there, moſt-what both things true, juſt and uſeful very particularly ſometimes, and Words too are invented to our Hands. And as for our apprehending, conceiving and being affected with ſuch things as our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſhould contain; many things we can in ſome meaſure apprehend and are affected withal in general, as God's Power, his Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipreſence, his Univerſal Goodneſs, his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, his Juſtice, our own Temporal Wants and Mercies at leaſt, ſome very groſs and palpable Sins. Begin we here and mind we theſe things firſt. And then as for other more particular and more ſpiritual things, we muſt and may apply our Minds, excite and ſtir up our Affections to them. The oftner we do this the better we ſhall do it, let us begin and try and uſe our ſelves to it a while. How many who make this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe of Non-Ability, are unwilling and backward ſo much as to joyn with others in praying either in Publick or Private?
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:94938:232"/> A ſign they have no Mind or Inclination to it, they care not for their Duty, and they are willing to be and do ſo ſtill, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge themſelves in it. Let Perſons but uſe themſelves to come and be preſent at Prayers, they'l find in time ſome good or other of it; they'l ſometime or other appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend ſomething, ſometime or other their Affections may be touched, and they may begin to find ſomething which may pleaſe there. Howſoever they will not be ſo averſe thereform, it will not be ſo tedious to them. This eſpecially if People live pretty ſober Lives, and they are not addicted to things which they know to be materially evil and naught; but their chief Fault hath been, they have not minded their due End in their Actions ſo much as they might have done.</p>
                  <p>(2.) All this Non-Ability except again that of Ineptneſs to apprehend and to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with Spiritual things, or the Matter of our Prayers (which is to be remedied as aforeſaid) is no reaſonable Excuſe for our not uſing others Prayers or Forms, either in the Scripture as the Lord's Prayer, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by judicious and pious perſons. For here again are good Matter and Words ready for us, and cannot we read or repeat theſe with Underſtanding and hearty Affections;
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:94938:233"/> or learn them and repeat them by heart, whether we can or cannot read? The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and ignoranteſt and thoſe who cannot read (who, I hope, will be every day few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er) can learn ſome ſuch Prayers without Book, ſhorter or longer, fewer or more, ſuch as the Lord's Prayer and other Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: none hath ſo bad a Memory as to do nothing in this kind. And that all may have the leſs Excuſe let Parents and thoſe who Educate Children teach them ſome ſuch Prayers as ſoon as may be. That Perſons may begin as ſoon as they are capable of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding things to take notice of God their Creator and Suſtainer from whom they have every thing.</p>
                  <p>(3.) I have propounded ſome Means al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready which Men are able to make uſe of, and by the Uſe of which Men may either be preſent at and joyn with others Prayers, or read and repeat judicious and devout Forms of Prayers with Underſtanding and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in ſome degree or other; and they may ſtill further advance (ſome at leaſt) to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Prayers of their own out of others Prayers, or their own Inventions and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, or both together. Can we not read nor hear read the Holy Scripture and underſtand the plain places, and ſome of us the obſcure by others Explication? Can we
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:94938:233"/> not read other good Religious Books or hear them read? can we not ſometimes retire, meditate, reflect, think of God and our ſelves what we are, what we would be, what we ſhould be, what we ſhall be? Can we not read, obſerve, commit to Memory the Patterns of other wiſe and good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans whether ſpoken or written? Can we not pray to God to help and aſſiſt us to obtain one or more of the Qualifications of good Prayers, eſpecially Sincerity and Fervency? I ſay, cannot Perſons uſe theſe Means? I think they can: All of them ſome or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more or leſs. I know there are many Degrees in theſe things, ſome Men can make uſe of more of theſe Means, and more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently; All Men have not the like Ability or Opportunity: but all have ſome. And I do not think but the moſt buſie, dull, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and inept Perſons may uſe more Means to be better than they are. No Men that are imperfect and bad do all they can to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come better: Not ſo much as the Beggar who goes from Door to Door, or ſits upon the Dung-hill, or waits upon Swine and Beaſts. And this is that which will be laid to their Charge be ſure, whatever elſe will, and which will condemn them.</p>

                  <p>(3.) A Third Excuſe is, that they want Time, they have not Time. If by not having Time Men mean that they do always employ themſelves in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing or other beſides their Prayers, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it is true; for no Man can be perfectly idle ſo as to do or think nothing: But if they mean they cannot have Time, this I deny, I think there is no Man ſo occupied and employed, who cannot get ſome Time more or leſs, and I confine not all Men to any certain Frequency or Length: Nay, I think few Men but may get ſome Time daily without hindrance or let to their other juſt Affairs; but it would rather prove a help. It is manifeſt by Experience, that there are few Mens Lives in which there are not thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of trifling unprofitable and ſinful and miſchievous Actions. How much Time paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth away by Men with their Hands in their Pockets, they do not know what to do, they are fain to caſt about and invent ſomething to ſpend their Time in, or they are prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to take what's next, and that's uſually none of the beſt? How many Hours are ſpent in unprofitable ſinful Chat and Talk, in Swearing by God and Curſing others;
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:94938:234"/> and yet they cannot have Time to pray to God, and pray for themſelves and others? How much Time ſuperfluous do Men ſpend in Plays, Games, and Exerciſes, in Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and turning down ſuperfluous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicating Cups; and yet ſome few Minutes cannot be gotten to pray neither in Publick, Private nor Secret? For publick Prayers and other parts of the Worſhip of God, reading and explaining his Word and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, How many ſit at Home and ſleep or do any trifling Action, or chuſe ſomething to do on purpoſe on that Time, which they might as well or better do at another, or wander about idly?</p>
                  <p>Beſides, on the Lord's day are not all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Occupations, at leaſt the moſt unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, by Law and Conſent laid aſide on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that Men might have Time? they have it then for private and ſecret Devotion as well as for publick; and yet we ſee moſt Men will not take it. What reaſon then have we to think that Men cannot find Time on other days, when we ſee they will not make uſe of it when it is put into their hands? Nor do I think that Men generally are ſo toiled or tired or dull with their week's Work, but that they might take ſome Time on that day.</p>
                  <p>Further, If thy Employments ſhould be
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:94938:235"/> more innocent, uſeful or p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>fitable, and ſhould fill up all thy Time (which I do not think but that ſome days at leaſt there is leiſure) make ſome room for thy Prayers, get ſome Time. By what right have thoſe things all thy Time, and thy Prayers none at all? Sure I am thy Prayers deſerve it as well as moſt other of thy moſt uſeful Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and are as good and neceſſary even to thee; but why then ſhould they alone be excluded from ſome ſhare of thy Time, and all other Things have theirs? why ſhould they not have ſo much as a few Minutes in a day? For ſome Sport or Game or Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement even daily thou wouldſt make Time in thy moſt profitable and uſeful Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs: Thou wouldſt begin them ſooner, or defer them longer, or end them later, or diſpatch them quicker; why not then for thy Prayers? which ſure are ſometimes at leaſt as good as thy Divertiſements. Time! we cannot get Time! can we have Time to think and talk of our Neighbour's good Qualities (and it is well if we did it oftner) t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> inſtance in, to praiſe and magnifie the worthy Endowments and Deeds of any vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, diſcreet and beneficent Perſon, and how much we and the Town or the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try or the Publick is beholding to him; and yet we cannot have Time to acknowledge
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:94938:235"/> God's Power, Wiſdom and Goodneſs of which our Lives and all the Univerſe are full, and every thing thou or others are or do is in him and by him? Time! have we not Time to thank God for his numberleſs and incomparable paſt Favours, preſent Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings and future Hopes, for which we need not ſtir over our Threſholds; and yet can get it to make civil Viſits on purpoſe to thank Perſons for any conſiderable Inſtances of their Kindneſs? (though Men are not apt to be over grateful here neither.) Time! why ſhould we have Time to enjoy and make uſe of all other God's Favours, and not of this, which is the greateſt of all from whence ſprings the moſt ſweet ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Pleaſure, (<hi>viz.</hi>) our Capacity of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to, honouring, truſting in, depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon, loving God, offering, profeſſing, reſolving our Love, Service and Obedience to him. If we be under any Affliction, and our Soul bowed down with Grief, or in any Perplexity or difficult Affair, we can find Time to unboſome our ſelves to a Friend to crave their Counſel, their Comfort, their Aſſiſtance any other way; and we cannot forſooth have Time to do this ſame thing to God the beſt Friend we have in the World, who would by making us good make us ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of receiving and then moſt freely give us all other good things.</p>
                  <pb n="420" facs="tcp:94938:236"/>
                  <p>Oh fooliſh and ungrateful Creatures! all this Excuſe of want of Time is but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and is indeed a ſign of ſottiſh Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of our own good, and of the badneſs of our own Hearts and Lives. We know not our own Happineſs, and are perfectly loth to think of God, and of ſuch things as ſhould be in our Prayers, leſt we ſhould be engaged to be good, and have our Minds and Affections taken off from worldly things to be ſet upon better and then pretend we have no Time.</p>
                  <p>The more plain Truth is, we Would have no Time, and are glad we can order it ſo as to have none, at leaſt we are very well content; and then we complain and excuſe it thus. But let us not endeavour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive others and our ſelves, it is better to confeſs the Truth, that we have no Mind nor Will, and then we ſhall be ſomewhat nearer mending the Fault.</p>
                  <p>And now it remains only that all perſons be earneſtly exhorted to the performance of this Duty ſo acceptable to God, ſo beneficial to others, ſo profitable and comfortable to our ſelves, which will render us wiſer, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, happier, and whereby we may obtain all good things from God. That they would frequent publick Prayers upon all juſt Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, and ſometimes if not for their own Benefit, yet for good Example to others who
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:94938:236"/> want it: as alſo hearing the Scriptures Read, and Preaching, that is the expounding, confirming, applying of the Scripture. That they would enter alſo into their Cloſets and Pray in ſecret to God their heavenly Fath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>, eſpecially upon ſolemn Occaſions, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 words">
                        <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> and after the publick Worſhip of God, on Lord's days and other days, and moſt eſpe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cially before the Lord's Supper. That they would alſo Pray in private with their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies as many as they can get together or ſpare, and this either by judicious and pious Prayers compoſed by others, or their own if they be able. All this as frequently and in ſuch manner as their Ability and Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity will permit: And that they would not let ſluggiſhneſs or lazineſs, deadneſs to holy things, nay, hatred and averſation from thoſe things which will make them better to hinder them, ſatisfying themſelves with ſome Pretences and falſe Excuſes, which God and their Conſciences even now, much leſs another day will never allow of. I leave it with Men's Conſciences: out of hearty love to God, to them and my ſelf I have diſcharged mine to them. I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident we following this Advice, ſhould all be ſoon much a better and ſoberer People, live more conſcientiouſly, piouſly, chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably, peaceably, comfortably both to our
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:94938:237"/> ſelves and others, and all the Bleſſings of God would be multiplied upon us all here, and we ſhould be more fitted for Heaven hereafter.</p>
